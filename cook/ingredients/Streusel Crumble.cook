Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a #sheet pan{} with #parchment paper{}.

In a #stand mixer{} fitted with the paddle attachment (or in a large bowl using a spatula), combine the @all-purpose @flour{250%g}, @hazelnut flour{250%g}, @sugar{250%g}, and @fleur de sel{6%g}. Add the @butter{250%g} and mix to combine. Using your fingers, break up the streusel dough into pieces about the size of marbles. (Alternatively, push the dough through the holes of a wire rack to get pieces of a more uniform size.)

Spread the streusel over the prepared pan and bake until golden, 10 to ~{12%minutes}. The edges should be crunchy and the inside still soft. Let cool completely.
