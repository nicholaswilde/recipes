Place the @extra-virgin olive oil{0.25%cup} in a #large heavy pot{} (such as a Dutch oven) over medium heat. Add the @carrots{2%lbs} (peeled and roughly chopped), @yellow onion{1%large} (chopped), @fresh ginger{1%3-inch piece} (peeled and finely chopped), and @ground dried ginger{2%tsp} and season with a large pinch of @kosher salt{}. Cook, stirring now and then until the vegetables begin to soften, about ~{10%minutes}.

Add the @full-fat coconut milk{1%13.5-oz can} and @vegetable broth{4%cups}. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat to a simmer and season to taste with salt (the exact amount depends on how salty your broth is). Cover the pot and cook until the carrots are incredibly tender, about ~{20%minutes}.

Use an #immersion blender{} to puree everything together (or do this in batches in a regular #blender{}). Season the soup to taste with salt and serve hot, topped with @chili oil{}.
