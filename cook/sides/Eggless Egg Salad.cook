Put one-quarter of the block of @firm tofu{1%pkg} in a #food processor{} with @celery plug leaves{0.5%stalk}, @shallot{1%clove}, @dry dill{1/4%tsp}, @fresh dill{1/2%tsp}, @tumeric{1/2%tsp}, @dijon mustard{1%tsp}, @dill pickle relish{2%tsp}, @onion powder{1/4%tsp}, @garlic powder{1/4%tsp}, and @mayonnaise{1/4%cup}. Blend until combined.

Add the remaining three-quarter block of tofu and pulse until mixed but not smooth, keeping a course texture. Taste. Adjust ingredients and @sea salt{} to your liking. Add more @turmeric{} if it needs more authentic egg salad color.
