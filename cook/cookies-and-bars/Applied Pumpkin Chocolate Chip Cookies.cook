Preheat oven to 325°F. Line a #baking sheet{} with #parchment paper{}.

Remove the @unsalted butter{1/2%cup} form the refrigerator and let it sit at room temperature until softened.

In a #large mixing bowl{}, combine softened butter, @brown sugar{1/2%cup}, and @granulated sugar{1/2%cup}. Beat until creamy. Add @egg{1%large} and @vanilla{1%tsp}, then beat for about ~{4%minutes}, until fully incorporated.

In a separate #bowl{}, whisk together the @salt{1%tsp}, @baking soda{1%tsp}, @baking powder{1%tsp}, and @pumpkin pie spice{1%Tbsp}.

Gradually add the dry ingredients to the butter mixture, mixing just until combined. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl as needed.

Stir in the @pumpkin puree{1%15-oz can} until the dough is smooth and fully mixed.

Fold in the @mini chocolate chips{1%cup} until evenly distributed throughout the dough.

Cover bowl and chill the dough in the refrigerator for ~{20%minutes}. This helps prevent spreading and improve texture.

Portion the dough onto the prepared baking sheet using an #ice cream scoop or spoon{}. Bake for 12 to ~{18%minutes}, or until the edges are golden and the centers are set. Baking time may vary depending on cookie size.
