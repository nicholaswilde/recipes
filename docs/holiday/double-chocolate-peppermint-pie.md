### Step 4

Combine heavy cream, the remaining 1/2 cup sugar, and desired amount of red food coloring (optional) in a chilled bowl.

Beat on high until stiff peaks form (tops stand straight). Add a spoonful of whipped cream to cream cheese mixture. Add
cream cheese mixture to whipped cream; find to combine.

### Step 6

Spoon filling into pie crust. Chill pie 3 to 6 hours or until cold. Serve the same day the pie is made. Drizzle with hot
