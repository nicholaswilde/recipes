- :bowl_with_spoon: 0.5 cup [good gravy][1]
- :potato: 1 cup [mashed potatoes][2]
- :stuffed_flatbread: 1 cup [stuffing][3]

- 1 baking sheet
- 1 parchment paper
- 1 cooking twine
- 1 circular cutter

## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Tip the warm [hot water crust][4] pastry dough onto a lightly floured worktop and gently work until it forms a smooth
ball. Divide it in half. Set aside one quarter of each portion for the lids and keep covered with plastic wrap until
needed. Form the rest of one portion of dough into a ball, then flatten slightly. Set a dolly on top of the flattened
disc. Using your hands, mold the still warm dough around the dolly. Try to make sure the dough is the same thickness on
the sides, that the dough on the base is not too thick and that there are no holes. Repeat with the other portion of
dough. Set the molded pie cases on the lined baking sheet and chill for about 20 minutes or until really firm.

### Step 2

Roll out the 2 saved portions of dough to make discs 13 cm across, or to fit the size of the pies you’ve molded. Make
a hole in the center of each lid, then chill them for about 20 minutes.

### Step 3

Wrap the outside of the pie case with a strip of parchment paper and tie cooking twine around the pie case to help keep
its shape.

### Step 4

Add a tablespoon of [good gravy][1] to the pie case.

### Step 5

Fill up half of the pie case with [mashed potatoes][2]. Add a teaspoon of gravy on top.

### Step 6

Fill up the rest of the pie case with [stuffing][3]. If stuffing is too dry, add a teaspoon of gravy on top.

### Step 7

Set a top on each pie and crimp the lid and the rim of the pastry case together with your thumb and forefinger to seal
thoroughly.

### Step 8

Beat the egg with one tablespoon of water. Brush top with egg wash.

### Step 9

Optionally, make decorative leaves with the left over pastry dough by using a circular cutter, pinching one end of the
leaves, and score down the middle and along the sides. Adhere the leaves to the top of the pies with the egg wash. Add
more egg wash on top of the leaves.

### Step 10

Bake mini pies in a 385°F oven for 20 minutes or until the pastry has puffed up and has developed a nice golden color.
