## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Heat the extra virgin olive oil (or butter) in a large saucepan over medium-high heat until melted. Add crushed red
pepper flakes and sauté for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally.

### Step 2

Add small yellow onion (finely diced) and sauté for 5 minutes or until softened and translucent, stirring occasionally.

### Step 3

Add garlic (minced or pressed) and sauté for 2 minutes more or until fragrant, stirring occasionally.

### Step 4

Add in the whole tomatoes (preferably San Marzano) and stir to combine. Continue cooking, breaking up the tomatoes with
a wooden spoon or potato masher, until the sauce reaches a low simmer.

### Step 5

Reduce heat to medium to maintain a steady simmer. Let the sauce cook uncovered for about 25 minutes to 30 minutes,
stirring occasionally, until thickened and desired consistency is reached.

### Step 6

Stir in the fresh basil leaves (packed, torn or roughly-chopped), fine sea salt, and freshly-cracked black pepper. Taste
and season with extra salt, pepper, or crushed red pepper flakes as needed.

### Step 7

Serve immediately or refrigerate in a sealed container for up to 4 days.
