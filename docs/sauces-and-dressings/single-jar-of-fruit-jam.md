!!! note

    This jam calls for just two cups of chopped fruit. This is about one pint of berries, four to six peaches or plums,
    or eight small apricots.

### Step 1

Wash and cut the fruit. Wash and hull the fruit as needed. Cut large strawberries into quarters and peaches into
bite-sized pieces.

### Step 2

Combine the fruit with sugar and mash. Combine the fruit with the sugar and lemon juice in a medium, heavy-bottomed
saucepan. Gently mash with a wooden spoon until the fruit is juicy and most of the sugar is dissolved.

### Step 3

Cook until jammy. Cook over a medium heat, continuing to mashing down on the fruit with a wooden spoon. Bring to a
rolling boil and continue to cook, stirring frequently, until the jam is thick and darkened in color, about 20 minutes.

### Step 4

Transfer the jam to an 8-oz jar and refrigerate. Carefully spoon into a very clean (8-ounce) jar and let cool to room
temperature. Seal the jar and refrigerate.
