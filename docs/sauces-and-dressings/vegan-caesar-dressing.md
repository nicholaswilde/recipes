## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

To a small mixing bowl, add [plain hummus][2], spicy mustard, lemon zest, lemon juice, minced capers + brining juice,
and minced garlic, and whisk thoroughly to combine. Olive oil (optional) is optional, but will add a bit more
creaminess.

### Step 2

Add a little hot water to thin until pourable and whisk until creamy and smooth. Taste and adjust flavor as needed,
adding more salt and pepper, lemon juice, or minced garlic if desired! Maple syrup (optional) will help offset how salty
and briney this dressing is, if you find you need it.

### Step 3

Use immediately, or store in the refrigerator up to 5-7 days.

### Step 4

This dressing is delicious on kale, romaine, and arugula. It would also be great on roasted vegetables, especially
Brussels sprouts and potatoes. Top with a little [vegan Parmesan cheese][3] for the ultimate Caesar salad experience.
