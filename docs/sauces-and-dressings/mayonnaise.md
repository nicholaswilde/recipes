!!! note
    Do not substitute olive oil for the vegetable oil; the mayonnaise will turn out bitter.

### Step 1

Process egg, white wine vinegar, Dijon mustard, salt, and sugar in food processor until combined, about 5 seconds. With
processor running, slowly drizzle in vegetable oil until emulsified and mixture is thick, about 2 minutes. Scrape down

refrigerate until ready to use. (Mayonnaise can be refrigerated for up to 1 week.)
