## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Melt in a large heavy saucepan or Dutch oven butter.

### Step 2

Add Mirepoix or finely chopped onions, carrots, and celery. Cook, stirring, until the vegetables begin to color.

### Step 3

Add 1/2 cup all-purpose flour. Cook, stirring until the flour is thoroughly browned.

### Step 4

Stir in whole black peppercorns, drained, peeled and finely chopped canned tomatoes or 2 cups tomato purée and coarsely
chopped parsley.

### Step 5

Add Brown Beef Stock.

### Step 6

Increase the heat to high and bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer until reduced by half, 2 to 2.5 hours.
Stir occasionally and skim off the fat as it rises to the top. The sauce should be the consistency of heavy cream, no
thicker.

### Step 7

Strain the sauce through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl. Stir occasionally as the sauce cools to prevent the formation of
a skin. If necessary, then the additional stock or water. If using this sauce as is, season with salt and pepper to
taste.
