- :glass_of_milk: 1 cup [milk][2]
- :salt: some salt
- :salt: some pepper
- :chestnut: 1 pinch nutmeg

## :cooking: Cookware

- 1 medium saucepan

## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Make a blond roux.

### Step 2

Remove the medium saucepan from the heat and slowly whisk in 1 cup of cold milk 1/3 at a time.

### Step 3

Return the pan to heat and bring to a simmer, whisking constantly to prevent clumps. Continue to cook, whisking until
sauce is smooth and hot and has thickened, 1 to 2 minutes.

### Step 4

Season to taste with salt, pepper, and nutmeg.

### Step 5

For better consistency, scald the milk before adding it to the roux. For improved flavor, add to the milk before
scalding thick onion slice (optional), 2 whole cloves (optional), and 1 bay leaf (optional) then cover and let stand for
15 minutes; remove the cloves and bay leaf, if used, and whisk into the roux.

## Recipe Variations

| Sauce   | Modification |
|---------|--------------|
| Mornay  | Add 1/2 cup grated cheese to 1 cup of hot sauce; stir over low heat until cheese is melted. Season with a little mustard or Worcestershire sauce to taste. |
| Velouté | Substitute chicken, beef, fish, or vegetable broth for the milk. |
| Herb    | Add 1 teaspoon of freshly chopped herbs or 1/2 teaspoon dried herbs to 1 cup of hot sauce. Cook for a minute or two longer to get more flavor from the herbs. |
| Cream   | Add 2 or 3 tablespoons of heavy cream to the finished sauce. For an onion flavor, add an onion slice to the milk when heating; remove onion slice before adding milk to flour and butter mixture. |
| Mustard | Combine 1 teaspoon dry mustard to flour used in sauce. This sauce is especially good with fish and chicken. |
