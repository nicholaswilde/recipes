## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Combine extra firm silken tofu, roasted red bell pepper, chipotle peppers, garlic, cumin, and the juice and zest of 1
lime in the bowl of a food processor and puree until smooth and creamy.

### Step 2

Store refrigerated for up to 7 days.

### Step 3

Note: To roast red bell peppers, hold them over an open flame and roast them until black, turning as needed to roast all
sides. Place them in a plastic bag and let them cool. When they are cool, peel the skin off. Do not rinse them, or you
will lose all of the roasted flavor.

### Step 4

Note: You can use jarred fire-roasted red peppers instead.

### Step 5

Note: For a milder version of this recipe omit or cut in half the chipotle peppers in adobo sauce. You may add a
teaspoon of smoked paprika in its place.
