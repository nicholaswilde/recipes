## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

This sauce comes together quickly once you get started, so measure the dry ingredients (the all-purpose flour, chili
powder, cumin, garlic powder, oregano, salt and cinnamon (optional)) into a small bowl and place it near the stove.
Place the tomato paste and vegetable broth near the stove as well.

### Step 2

In a medium-sized pot over medium heat, warm the olive oil until it’s hot enough that a light sprinkle of the
flour/spice mixture sizzles on contact. This might take a couple of minutes, so be patient and don’t step away from
the stove!

### Step 3

Once it’s ready, pour in the flour and spice mixture. While whisking constantly, cook until fragrant and slightly
deepened in color, about 1 minute. Whisk the tomato paste into the mixture, then slowly pour in the broth while whisking
constantly to remove any lumps.

### Step 4

Raise heat to medium-high and bring the mixture to a simmer, then reduce heat as necessary to maintain a gentle simmer.
Cook, whisking often, for about 5 to 7 minutes, until the sauce has thickened a bit and a spoon encounters some
resistance as you stir it. (The sauce will thicken some more as it cools.)

### Step 5

Remove from heat, then whisk in the apple cider or distilled white  vinegar and season to taste with a generous amount
of freshly ground black pepper. Add more salt, if necessary (I usually add another pinch or two).
