    This is a copycat of [TJ's Corn and Chile Tomato-less Salsa][1]

### Step 1

Toss the sweet corn kernels and finely chopped red pepper together in a mixing bowl. Set aside.

### Step 2

In a large saucepan, combine the vinegar, sugar, water, mustard seeds, and cumin seeds. Pace the pan over medium-high
heat until it begins to boil. Reduce the liquid to a simmer. Add the chopped red onion and ground red pepper. Simmer
until the onion becomes translucent, about 10 minutes. To the simmering liquid, add the sweet corn and chopped red
pepper. Simmer for 5 minutes. Remove from heat.

### Step 3

Using a slotted spoon, transfer the corn salsa to a non-reactive container, pressing down lightly to pack the corn.
Gently pour the remaining cooking liquid from the saucepan over the packed salsa just until it is covered. Refrigerate
for a day before serving (to allow the flavors to develop).

### Step 4

Serve with chips for dipping.
