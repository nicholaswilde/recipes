## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Simmer the Yokon gold potatoes, peeled and sliced, and sliced white leek in them in [vegetable stock][1] (along with a
pinch of salt) until tender. Julia Child recommends simmering in a partially covered pot for about 40 to 50 minutes.

### Step 2

Once the vegetables are tender, you can puree the soup using an immersion blender, or carefully transfer the soup to a
high-powered pitcher blender and puree until smooth.

### Step 3

Season with salt and white pepper to taste and stir in 1/2 to 1 cup of whipping cream.

### Step 4

I served the soup with a garnish of minced chives as Julia suggests.

### Step 5

Editor’s Note: White pepper is recommended in this recipe because it blends in with the color of the soup. If all you
have is black pepper, that’s perfectly fine to use.
