## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Heat olive oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the chopped garlic cloves, large yellow onion, and
finely chopped ginger. Season with Kosher salt and black pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion is
translucent and begins to brown slightly at the edges, about 3 minutes to 5 minutes.

### Step 2

Add ground turmeric, red-pepper flakes, and the drained chickpeas. Season again with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring
frequently, for 8 minutes to 10 minutes, allowing the chickpeas to sizzle and fry in the spices and oil until they start
to break down and become a little browned and crisp.

### Step 3

Remove about 1 cup of the cooked chickpeas and set them aside for garnish.

### Step 4

Using a wooden spoon or spatula, further crush the remaining chickpeas in the pot slightly to release their starchy
insides. This will help thicken the stew.

### Step 5

Pour in the full-fat coconut milk and vegetable stock. Season with salt and pepper. Bring the mixture to a simmer,
scraping up any bits that have formed on the bottom of the pot.

### Step 6

Cook, stirring occasionally, until the stew has thickened, which typically takes 30 minutes to 35 minutes. If you desire
a thicker stew after this time, continue to simmer until it reaches your preferred consistency.

### Step 7

Add the torn Swiss chard, kale, or collard greens to the pot, ensuring they are submerged in the liquid. Cook for an
additional 5 minutes to 7 minutes, or until the greens have wilted and softened.

### Step 8

Divide the stew among bowls. Garnish each serving with the reserved chickpeas, fresh mint leaves, a sprinkle of
red-pepper flakes (if desired), and a drizzle of olive oil. Serve with yogurt and toasted pita or flatbread, if using.
