## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Combine the vegetable broth and unsweetened soy milk in a medium bowl, then whisk in the cornstarch until it's fully
incorporated with no lumps.

### Step 2

Heat a large heavy-bottomed soup pot over medium-high heat. Put the whole poblanos peppers in the dry pot and char the
skin, turning every 5 minutes or so, until they are blackened and blister all the way around. Place the poblanos in a
bowl and cover them to steam for 20 minutes.

### Step 3

Add the corn kernels to the dry pot over medium-high heat and blister them, stirring regularly, for about 2 minutes.
Remove from the pot and set aside. When cool enough to handle, stem and seed the poblanos with a knife, then remove the
skin and dice the peppers.

### Step 4

Pour the avocado oil into the pot, then add the chopped onion, seeded and chopped jalapeño, and garlic; saute for 2
minutes or until they begin to soften. Add the cumin, coriander, oregano, and salt, stir to combine, and let it cook for
1 minute more.

### Step 5

Add the broth-soy milk mixture to the pot, stirring well. Let everything come to a boil before adding the 3/4" cubed
Yukon gold potatoes. Stir and bring to a boil again. Lower the heat to a simmer. Add the lime juice and cilantro, stir
again, and let simmer until the potatoes are fork-tender, about 20 minutes.

### Step 6

Garnish each bowl with fresh cilantro and serve.
