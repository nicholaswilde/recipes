## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Place the extra-virgin olive oil in a large heavy pot (such as a Dutch oven) over medium heat. Add the carrots (peeled
and roughly chopped), yellow onion (chopped), fresh ginger (peeled and finely chopped), and ground dried ginger and
season with a large pinch of kosher salt. Cook, stirring now and then until the vegetables begin to soften, about 10
minutes.

### Step 2

Add the full-fat coconut milk and vegetable broth. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat to a simmer and season to taste
with salt (the exact amount depends on how salty your broth is). Cover the pot and cook until the carrots are incredibly
tender, about 20 minutes.

### Step 3

Use an immersion blender to puree everything together (or do this in batches in a regular blender). Season the soup to
taste with salt and serve hot, topped with chili oil.
