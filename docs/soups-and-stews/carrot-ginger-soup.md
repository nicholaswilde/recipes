## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Add the olive oil to a large saucepan or pot over medium heat. Once it’s heated, add the onions (chopped) and cook
until tender, stirring occasionally, around 5 minutes.

### Step 2

Add the carrots (chopped) and fresh ginger (peeled and sliced). (Alternatively, use ground ginger). Stir to coat and
cook for another 5 minutes to 7 minutes.

### Step 3

Add the garlic cloves (chopped) and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.

### Step 4

Pour in the vegetable broth and bring it to a boil. Then reduce the heat to a simmer and cook for 20 minutes to 30
minutes, or until the carrots are tender.

### Step 5

Remove the pan from heat and stir in the apple cider vinegar. Then allow the soup to cool slightly.

### Step 6

Purée the soup in a blender, working in batches if necessary. Blend on low speed for a few seconds, then slowly
increase speed to create a creamy soup.

### Step 7

To serve, pour the soup into bowls and garnish with desired toppings: cashew cream or sour cream, pumpkin seeds, hemp
seeds or fresh parsley (chopped).
