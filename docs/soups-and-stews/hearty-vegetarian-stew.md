## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Heat vegetable oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Toss 1/2" cubed butternut squash in salt, pepper, and flour to
coat evenly. Add to pot in a single layer; make sure oil is hot before adding. Cook until squash is browned and golden
around edges, about 5 minutes.

### Step 2

Add chopped yellow onions and fresh thyme. Saute until onions are tender, about 2 minutes. Add minced garlic and saute
for about 30 seconds, then add Marsala wine, halved mushrooms, red kidney beans, and tomato paste and stir to combine.
Add enough vegetable broth to cover squash.

### Step 3

Season the stew with additional salt and pepper.

### Step 4

Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to a simmer and cover for 45 minutes, or until squash is tender.

### Step 5

If a thicker consistency is desired, let simmer for another 25 to 30 minutes.

### Step 6

When ready, sprinkle with chopped parsley and serve hot.
