## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Beat the eggs, granulated sugar, salt, and vanilla until well combined.

### Step 2

Stir in the all-purpose flour and baking powder, mixing until smooth.

### Step 3

Add the melted butter, again mixing until smooth; the batter will be thick and soft.

### Step 4

Heat your pizzelle iron. Grease it as directed in the manufacturer's instructions. As the iron heats, the batter will
stiffen.

### Step 5

Cook the pizzelle according to the instructions that came with your iron. In general, they'll take between 45 seconds
and 2 1/2 minutes to brown.

### Step 6

Remove the pizzelle from the iron, and cool on a cooking rack. If desired, use a pair of scissors to trim any ragged
edges.

### Step 7

Dust cooled pizzelle with confectioners' sugar, if desired.

!!! tip

    Flavor to taste: classic pizzelle are often flavored with anise extract or anise seed. Butter-rum,
    lemon, or rum flavors are also delicious. Simply add extract to the batter to taste. Start with 1/4 teaspoon;
    amounts will vary a lot, depending on the strength of the extract you choose.

!!! tip

    One reader suggests the best way to grease your pizzelle iron is to dip a towel in vegetable oil, and wipe it all
    over the iron's interior plates. This helps avoid the sticky residue you may get from spraying the iron with
    non-stick spray.
