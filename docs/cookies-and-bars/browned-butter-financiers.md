### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Generously butter the insides of 24 mini muffin tins with softened butter.

Cook unsalted butter in a saucepan over medium heat until browned and smells nutty. You need 75 g (2.5 oz) of liquid
brown butter. Let cool slightly.

### Step 3

In a medium bowl, combine the almond or hazelnut flour, granulated sugar, all-purpose flour, and salt.

### Step 4

Stir in the egg whites and vanilla or almond extract.

### Step 5

Add the brown butter to the mixture and stir until well combined.

### Step 6

Fill each indentation of the mini muffin tins almost to the top.

### Step 7

Rap the tins sharply on the counter to level the tops of the batter.

### Step 8

Bake for 13 minutes, or until nicely browned.

### Step 9

Let the financiers cool in the tins before removing them.
