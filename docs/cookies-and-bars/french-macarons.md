## :pencil: Instructions - Cookie

### Step 1

Sift the confectioners' sugar and [almond flour][1] into a bowl.

### Step 2

Clean all utensils with vinegar to remove all oils.

### Step 3

Add the room temperature egg whites into a very clean bowl.

### Step 4

Using an electric mixer, whisk egg whites. Once they begin to foam add the cream of tartar and then SLOWLY add the
granulated sugar.

### Step 5

Add the food coloring (optional) (if desired) and vanilla then mix in. Continue to beat until stiff peaks form.

### Step 6

Begin folding in the 1/3 of the dry ingredients.

### Step 7

Be careful to add the remaining dry ingredients and fold gently.

### Step 8

The final mixture should look like flowing lava, and be able to fall into a figure eight without breaking. Spoon into a
piping bag with a medium round piping tip and you’re ready to start piping.

### Step 9

Pipe one inch dollops onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper (this should be glued down with dabs of batter).
Tap on counter several times to release air bubbles. Use a toothpick to pop any air bubbles and fill any gaps. Allow to
sit for about 40 minutes, so that a skin forms, before placing in oven.

### Step 10

Bake at 300°F for 12 to 15 minutes, rotate tray after 7 minutes. Allow to cool completely before removing from baking
sheet.

## :pencil: Instructions - Buttercream Filling

### Step 11

Combine granulated sugar and water in medium saucepan. Heat over low heat while stirring until sugar dissolves.
Increase heat to medium- high and bring to a boil

### Step 12

Put egg yolks in a stand-mixer fitted with a whisk attachment and beat until thick and foamy.

### Step 13

Cook the sugar and water syrup until it reaches 240°F. Immediately remove from heat. With mixer running, SLOWLY drizzle
hot syrup into bowl with yolks.

### Step 14

Continue mixing until the bottom of the bowl is cool to the touch and the yolk mixture has cooled to room temperature.

### Step 15

Add in butter one cube at a time allowing each piece to incorporate before adding the next. Add vanilla and salt.
Continue mixing until buttercream is smooth and creamy. (About 5 to 6 minutes.) Add food coloring if desired.

### Step 16

After assembly, refrigerate overnight or for a full 24 hours so that the filling solidifies.
