## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Line a 9-by-13-inch baking pan with foil, then spray with nonstick baking spray.

### Step 2

In a medium bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, pumpkin pie spice, baking soda and kosher salt. Stir together and set
aside.

### Step 3

In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat together the unsalted butter (at room
temperature) and granulated sugar on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Beat in the egg and
vanilla extract until well combined.

### Step 4

With the mixer on low, add the pumpkin purée and beat until well blended. (It will look curdled at this point, and
that’s OK!)

### Step 5

Add the dry ingredients and mix until just incorporated. With the mixer still on low, add the white chocolate chips and
butterscotch chips (and chopped pecans or walnuts, if using), and mix until combined.

### Step 6

Spread the batter evenly into the prepared pan. Bake until the edges begin to pull away from the sides and a toothpick
inserted in the center comes out with just a few crumbs, 30 minutes to 35 minutes. Transfer the pan to a wire rack to
cool completely before cutting.

### Step 7

To serve, lift the blondies from the pan using the foil, transfer to a cutting board and peel off the foil. Cut into 24
squares using a sharp knife.
