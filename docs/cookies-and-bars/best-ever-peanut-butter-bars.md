## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

### Step 2

In a large mixing bowl, cream together the butter, granulated sugar, and light brown sugar. Add the eggs, vanilla
extract, and creamy peanut butter and mix well.

### Step 3

In a separate bowl, mix together the dry ingredients (baking soda, salt, all-purpose flour, old-fashioned rolled oats).

### Step 4

Add dry ingredients to the creamy mixture. Press firmly into a greased 9x13'' pan.

### Step 5

Bake at 350 degrees for 17 to 21 minutes or until no longer glossy, but just barely set in the center. Do not over-bake;
they will harden as they cool. Allow to cool completely before frosting.

### Step 6

Once cool, spread a thin layer of creamy peanut butter over the bars.

### Step 7

For the Chocolate Frosting: Add butter to a small skillet over medium heat. Once melted, stir in unsweetened cocoa
powder. Remove from heat and stir in milk, powdered sugar, and vanilla extract. Whisk until smooth, using electric
beaters to get out any lumps, if needed. Spread chocolate frosting over the top of the bars.
