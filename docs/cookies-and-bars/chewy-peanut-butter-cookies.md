## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350°F. Line two 18x13-in rimmed baking sheets with parchment
paper. Whisk all-purpose flour, baking soda, and salt together in medium bowl.

### Step 2

In large bowl, whisk dark brown sugar, creamy peanut butter, eggs, melted unsalted butter, honey, and vanilla until
smooth. Let the mixture stand for 3 minutes, then whisk for 30 seconds. Repeat the process of resting and whisking 2
more times until the mixture is thick, smooth, and shiny. Add flour mixture and stir with rubber spatula until soft,
homogeneous dough forms. Stir in chopped fine dry-roasted peanuts until evenly distributed.

### Step 3

Press plastic wrap against the dough and refrigerate for at least 1 hours, up to 72 hours.

### Step 4

Working with 2 Tbsps (40 g) dough at a time (or using [number 30 portion scoop][3]), roll dough into balls and evenly
space on prepared sheets (12 dough balls per sheet). Using your fingers, gently flatten dough balls until 2 inches in
diameter.

### Step 5

Bake cookies, 1 sheet at a time, until edges are just set and just beginning to brown, 10 to 12 minutes, rotating after
6 minutes. Let cookies cool on sheet for 5 minutes. Using wide metal spatula, transfer cookies to wire rack and let cool
completely before serving.
