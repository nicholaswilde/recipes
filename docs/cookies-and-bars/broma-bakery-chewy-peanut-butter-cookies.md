## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 350°F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Set aside.

### Step 2

In a stand mixer fit with the paddle attachment, beat the softened unsalted butter, [creamy peanut butter][1], white sugar
and [brown sugar][2] together until light and fluffy.

### Step 3

Scrape down the bowl and add the egg, egg yolk and vanilla extract. Mix well.

### Step 4

In a separate bowl sift together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and
mix until just combined.

### Step 5

Pour some extra granulated sugar into a small bowl. Using a cookie scoop, scoop the dough out into 1 inch balls, rolling
them in the granulated sugar first before  dropping them 2 inches apart on the prepared cookie sheet. Bake at 350°F for
12 minutes or until the cookies have puffed up and are set on the edges, but are still gooey in the middle. Allow to
cool completely before eating!
