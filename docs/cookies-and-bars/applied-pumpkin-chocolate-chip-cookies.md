## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat oven to 325°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

### Step 2

Remove the unsalted butter form the refrigerator and let it sit at room temperature until softened.

### Step 3

In a large mixing bowl, combine softened butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar. Beat until creamy. Add egg and
vanilla, then beat for about 4 minutes, until fully incorporated.

### Step 4

In a separate bowl, whisk together the salt, baking soda, baking powder, and pumpkin pie spice.

### Step 5

Gradually add the dry ingredients to the butter mixture, mixing just until combined. Scrape down the sides and bottom of
the bowl as needed.

### Step 6

Stir in the pumpkin puree until the dough is smooth and fully mixed.

### Step 7

Fold in the mini chocolate chips until evenly distributed throughout the dough.

### Step 8

Cover bowl and chill the dough in the refrigerator for 20 minutes. This helps prevent spreading and improve texture.

### Step 9

Portion the dough onto the prepared baking sheet using an ice cream scoop or spoon. Bake for 12 to 18 minutes, or until
the edges are golden and the centers are set. Baking time may vary depending on cookie size.
