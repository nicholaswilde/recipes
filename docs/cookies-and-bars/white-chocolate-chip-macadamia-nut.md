## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat your oven to 350°F.

### Step 2

Cream together your butter and granulated sugar until it’s light and fluffy. Add in the eggs and vanilla, mixing
thoroughly. Beat in the all-purpose flour, baking soda and salt.

### Step 3

When that is done, fold in the white chocolate chips and macadamia nuts by hand, and prepare to put them on some
parchment paper lined cookie sheets.

### Step 4

Drop by rounded teaspoonful onto the baking sheets OR if you want to make huge cookies, use an ice cream scoop sized
cookie scoop and drop them on the sheet, 6 to a sheet, well spaced apart.

### Step 5

Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, until golden brown and slightly underdone for the small cookies. Bake for 15 to 16 minutes
for the large, checking to make sure that the edges are baked completely and the middle is almost baked through but not
quite. Cool on the sheets completely.
