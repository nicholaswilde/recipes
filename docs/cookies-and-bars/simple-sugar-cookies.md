## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 350°F.

### Step 2

In a large bowl, beat together the vegetable shortening and sugar until smooth. Add the buttermilk and vanilla, again
beating until well combined. The mixture may look a bit curdled, which is OK. Add the nutmeg, flour, baking soda, and
salt to the wet ingredients and beat until the mixture forms a cohesive dough.

### Step 3

Drop the dough in round balls onto a parchment-lined baking sheet. They should be a bit bigger than a Ping-Pong ball, a
bit smaller than a golf ball. Using a cookie scoop (or a small ice cream scoop that holds about 2 level tablespoons of
liquid) makes this task extremely simple. Leave about 2 between the dough balls, as they’ll spread as they bake. If
you want a crisp cookie, flatten the cookies as described above. If you like a chewier center, leave them as is.

### Step 4

Bake the cookies for 16 to 18 minutes, until they’re just beginning to brown around the bottom edges. Remove them from
the oven and cool on a rack. As they cool, they’ll become crisp. If you want them to remain crisp, store them in an
airtight container when they’re totally cool. If you want them to get a bit chewy, store them in a bag with a slice of
apple.
