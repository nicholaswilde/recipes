- :coffee: 0.5 tsp espresso powder

## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Beat together the eggs, granulated sugar, vanilla, espresso powder, and salt till smooth.

### Step 2

Add the Dutch-process cocoa and baking powder, again beating till smooth.

### Step 3

Add the all-purpose flour, mixing till well combined. Add the melted unsalted butter, again mixing till well combined.

### Step 4

Bake pizzelle according to your pizzelle iron instructions. A tablespoon cookie scoop works well for scooping batter
onto the iron; a level scoopful of batter is the right size for most standard pizzelle makers.

### Step 5

To make two-tone pizzelle: Prepare plain pizzelle batter (optional), flavoring it with 1/2 teaspoon hazelnut flavor
(optional). Using a teaspoon scoop (which holds 2 level measuring teaspoons), drop a chestnut-sized ball of vanilla
batter just below center in the cooking area of the pizzelle iron. Drop a slightly smaller ball of chocolate batter just
above the center line, nestling it right next to the vanilla batter. Close the iron, and bake according to the
manufacturer's directions.
