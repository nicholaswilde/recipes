- :salt: 1 pinch salt
- :chocolate_bar: 100 g dark chocolate chunks (optional)

- 1 balloon whisk
- 1 wooden spoon
- 1 wire rack

## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 350°F. Grease and line a 30 x 23cm cake tin with baking parchment.

### Step 2

Put the roughly chopped dark chocolate and butter into a large heatproof bowl set over a pan of gently simmering water
(don’t let the bottom of the bowl touch the water underneath) and leave until melted, stirring occasionally.

### Step 3

Remove from the heat and cool the chocolate down by whisking in the granulated sugar and light brown sugar using a
balloon whisk. Add the eggs and vanilla extract and mix in with a wooden spoon until combined. Sift over the all-purpose
flour and salt and stir again until smooth and combined. Pour into the prepared tin, smoothing the top level.

### Step 4

Bake for 35 to 40 minutes, until cracked around the edges and soft in the middle (it will firm up as it cools), rotating
the tin halfway through baking.

### Step 5

If you are adding the dark chocolate chunks (optional), take the brownie out of the oven after 20 minutes and vigorously
throw the chunks of chocolate at the half-baked brownie so they break the surface. Return to the oven for the remaining
cooking time.

### Step 6

Transfer the brownie to a wire rack and leave it to cool in the tin, then cut into squares before serving. Once cooled,
the brownies will keep in an airtight container for up to a week. Alternatively, cool the cooked brownie in the tin for
10 minutes, then cut into squares and serve warm with a dollop of thick cream.
