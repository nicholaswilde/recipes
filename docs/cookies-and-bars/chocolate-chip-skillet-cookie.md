## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 350°F and generously grease a 10 inch cast iron skillet with butter. Set aside.

### Step 2

In a large mixing bowl combine the melted butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar. Beat until mixed together. Add in
the eggs, egg yolk, and vanilla extract. Mix well.

### Step 3

In separate bowl mix together the all-purpose flour, salt, baking powder and baking soda. Mix half the dry ingredients
into the wet until everything comes together. Slowly add in the remaining flour a little bit at a time, stopping if the
dough starts to get too dry. Fold in the semi sweet chocolate chips and the walnuts. Do not over mix.

### Step 4

Transfer the cookie dough to your prepared skillet and pat into an even layer.

### Step 5

Bake at 350°F for 40 minutes or until the edges are just golden brown and the center has puffed up but is still very
gooey in the middle.

### Step 6

Allow to cool for at least 15 minutes before serving with vanilla ice cream (optional). Best served warm!
