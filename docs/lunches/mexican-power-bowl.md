## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

### Step 2

Combine the dried black beans, low-sodium vegetable broth, diced large onion, minced garlic, ground cumin, dried Mexican
oregano, smoked paprika and bay leaf in a slow cooker.

### Step 3

Cook on LOW for 8 hours (7-8 hours) or HIGH for 4.5 hours (3.5-4.5 hours), until beans are tender.

### Step 4

Stir in salt and fresh lime juice. Remove bay leaf. Mash about 1 cup of beans against the side of the pot for a creamier
sauce. Cool completely.

### Step 5

### Step 6

Preheat oven to 425°F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.

### Step 7

Place the cubed sweet potatoes in a large bowl. Toss with vegetable broth or water (as liquid binder), then toss
thoroughly with the dry seasoning mix: chili powder, ground cumin, smoked paprika, garlic powder, dried oregano, salt,
and black pepper.

### Step 8

Spread cubes in a single, uncrowded layer across baking sheets. Roast for 40 minutes, flipping halfway through, until
tender and lightly caramelized. Cool completely.

### Step 9

### Step 10

Option A: Cut corn tortillas into strips. Toss with lime juice and salt. Bake at 375°F for 12 minutes.

### Step 11

Option B: Toast raw pepitas in a dry skillet over medium heat for 5 minutes until fragrant. Remove from heat and toss
with salt and cumin.

### Step 12

### Step 13

Place 1 cup of spinach (or mixed greens) and 1/2 cup cooked quinoa (or brown rice) in a container. Add 1/2 cup seasoned
black beans and 1/2 cup roasted sweet potatoes. Add your favorite salsa.

### Step 14

Top with your chosen crunchy topping and fresh additions right before eating: sliced avocado, freshly chopped cilantro,
diced red onion, or a wedge of fresh lime.
