## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Stir cream of tartar, salt, granulated sugar, and pepper together in small bowl. Sprinkle mixture on both sides of field
or heirloom tomato slices that are 3/4 inch thick. Spread 1 teaspoon [mayonnaise][1] on 1 side of each slice of bread.

### Step 2

Place 2 slices of hearty white sandwich bread, mayonnaise side down, in 12-inch skillet. Cook over medium heat, moving
bread if necessary for even browning, until underside is golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to cutting board
griddled side up. Cook remaining 2 bread slices until underside is golden brown, about 30 seconds. Let cool until
griddled side is crisp, about 2 minutes.

!!! note

    Choose ripe tomatoes that are heavy for their size. Larger tomato slices that cover the entire slice of bread are
    ideal. We developed this recipe with 3/2 by 5-inch slices of Arnold sandwich bread, and the amount of mayonnaise
    used in step 1 is just enough to thinly cover each slice. Adjust this amount as necessary if your bread has
    different dimensions.
