Grease a large cookie sheet. Set aside.

In a heavy 2-quart saucepan over medium heat, bring sugar, corn syrup, water, and salt to a boil. Stir until sugar is
dissolved. Stir in peanuts.

### Step 3

Set candy thermometer in place, and continue cooking. Stir frequently until the temperature reaches 300°F (150°C), or
