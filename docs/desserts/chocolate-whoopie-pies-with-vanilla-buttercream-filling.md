### Step 1

Preheat oven to 400°F. Sift together all-purpose flour, salt, unsweetened cocoa powder, baking soda, and baking powder.
Set aside. Line 2 baking pans with parchment paper. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment,
cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add egg, [buttermilk][1], and vanilla. Beat until well combined. Slowly
add dry ingredients. Mix until combined.

### Step 2

Using a 1-ounce ice cream scoop, place dough onto a parchment-lined baking pan, 12 per pan. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes.
Remove to a rack to cool. Repeat with remaining batter.

### Step 3

In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream butter until smooth and creamy, 2 to 3
minutes. With mixer on low speed, add 3 cups confectioners' sugar, milk, and vanilla; mix until light and fluffy. If
necessary, gradually add remaining cup sugar to reach desired consistency.

### Step 4

Transfer buttercream to a disposable pastry bag and snip the end. When cookies have cooled completely, pipe 2
tablespoons buttercream onto the flat side of half the cookies. Sandwich with remaining cookies, pressing down slightly
so that the filling spreads to the edge of the cookies.
