### Step 1

### Step 2

In a medium bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, cornstarch, salt, and baking powder.

In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream together the unsalted butter and granulated sugar until light
and fluffy, 3 to 4 minutes. add the egg whites, one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Add the vegetable oil
and vanilla and almond extract.

### Step 4

With the mixer running on low speed, add the dry mixture and the whole milk in two or three alternating batches and mix
until just barely combined, using a rubber spatula, gently fold in the rainbow sprinkles until they're evenly
distributed. Distribute the batter among the cake pans or muffin cups, spreading it out evenly if using cake pans.

Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Begin checking for doneness at 25 minutes for cakes and
20 minutes for cupcakes.

Let cool in the pans for 10 minutes and then turn onto a wire rack to cool completely.

### Step 7

To make the frosting: in a standing mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the unsalted butter until smooth and
gradually beat in the confectioners' sugar. Add the salt, vanilla, almond extract, and whole milk and beat to combine.

### Step 8

Frost the cake or cupcakes as desired and enjoy.
