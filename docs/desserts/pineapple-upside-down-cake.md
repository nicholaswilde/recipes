## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat oven to 350°F. Add 1/4 cup butter to an 8-inch square baking pan and place in oven to melt, 5 minutes. Remove
pan from oven and sprinkle brown sugar over butter. Layer pineapple fans over butter and sugar mixture to cover base
of pan; set aside.

### Step 2

In a large bowl, add TJ's Vanilla Cake and Baking cake mix, eggs, melted butter and milk. Stir to combine. Pour cake
batter evenly atop prepared pineapple fans. Place pan in oven on center rack and bake 45 minutes, until a toothpick
inserted in the center comes out clean. Remove pan from oven and immediately run a knife around edges to loosen cake.
Carefully flip pan onto a heatproof serving plate. Leave pan over plate for 5 minutes.

### Step 3

Remove baking pan and rearrange any pineapple slices that did not transfer to the cake. Serve warm, with TJ's Vanilla
Ice Cream, if desired.
