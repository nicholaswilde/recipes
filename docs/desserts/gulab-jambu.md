## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Sift 1/2 cup Bisquick into a medium bowl. Add 1 cup dried milk powder and whisk until combined. Melt 2 tablespoons ghee
in the microwave or on the stovetop. Pour into the [Bisquick][2] mixture and stir until the texture is crumbly and you can
visibly see no more [ghee][1]. Add 1/4 cup whole milk and stir until a sticky and wet dough forms.

### Step 2

Scoop out 1 to 1 1/2 teaspoons of the dough and roll in between your hands or pinch and press together until smooth and
oval in shape (or round if desired). Place on a baking sheet or large plate. Cover with a damp kitchen towel or plastic
wrap to keep them from drying out. Repeat until all the dough is formed, placing them in a single layer.

### Step 3

Cover with a kitchen towel or damp cloth. Let sit for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, make the chasni.

### Step 4

Place 1 1/2 cups water, 1 cup granulated sugar in a small pot (about 3 quarts). Add 4 green cardamom pods and crumble in
5 saffron strands. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring until the sugar dissolves. Continue boiling for 2 to
5 minutes.

### Step 5

Remove the pot from the heat. Add 1 teaspoon lemon juice (optional) and 1 teaspoon rose water (optional) if using. Cover
to keep warm.

### Step 6

Heat enough ghee or vegetable oil in a large saucepan to go about 1/3 inch up the sides over medium heat. The oil is
ready when you add a small piece of the dough and the ghee starts bubbling.

### Step 7

Fry the jambu in batches of 6 to 8: Slowly add one at a time to the hot oil. Fry, constantly moving them with a slotted
spoon so they fry evenly, until deep golden brown, about 2 minutes. Using the slotted spoon, transfer onto a plate.

### Step 8

Remove and discard the cardamom from the chasmi. Transfer the jambus to the chasni and let sit for 4 to 5 hours at room
temperature to soak. Eat as is, warm up again, or, do what we always did, which was to refrigerate them in an airtight
container for a few hours and eat chilled.
