## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 350°F.

### Step 2

Lightly grease a 9" x 13" pan or two 9" round cake pans.

### Step 3

Make the topping by whisking together the granulated sugar, salt, all-purpose flour, and cinnamon. Add the melted
butter, stirring until well combined. Set the topping aside.

### Step 4

Make the filling by mixing together the dark brown sugar, cinnamon, and unsweetened cocoa powder. Note that the cocoa
powder is used strictly for color, not flavor; leave it out if you like. Set it aside.

### Step 5

To make the cake, in a large bowl, beat together the unsalted butter, salt, granulated sugar, light brown sugar baking
powder, and vanilla until well combined and smooth.

### Step 6

Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.

### Step 7

In a separate bowl, whisk together the sour cream or plain yogurt and milk till well combined. You don't need to whisk
out all the lumps.

### Step 8

Add the all-purpose flour to the butter mixture alternately with the milk/sour cream mixture, beating gently to combine.

### Step 9

Pour/spread half the batter (a scant 3 cups) into the prepared pan(s), spreading all the way to the edges. If you're
using two 9" round pans, spread 1 1/3 cups batter in each pan.

### Step 10

Sprinkle the filling evenly on the batter.

### Step 11

Spread the remaining batter atop the filling. Use a table knife to gently swirl the filling into the batter, as though
you were making a marble cake. Don't combine filling and batter thoroughly; just swirl the filling through the batter.

### Step 12

Sprinkle the topping over the batter in the pan.

### Step 13

Bake the cake until it's a dark golden brown around the edges; medium-golden with no light patches showing on top, and a
toothpick or cake tester inserted into the center comes out clean, about 55 to 60 minutes for the 9" x 13" pan, 50 to 55
minutes for the 9" round pans. When pressed gently in the middle, the cake should spring back.

### Step 14

Remove the cake from the oven and allow it to cool for 20 minutes before cutting and serving. Serve cake right from the
pan.
