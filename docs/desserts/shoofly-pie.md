## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Sprinkle some flour onto a clean flat surface. Roll the [pie dough][1] into a flat round wide enough to fit a 9-inch
deep-dish pie plate. Fit the dough into the bottom and sides of the pie plate and trim the edges. Refrigerate it for 30
minutes.

### Step 2

Prepare the filling. Mix the brown sugar, molasses, egg, all-purpose flour, and baking soda in a large bowl. Gradually
pour in boiling water and stir. Allow the filling to cool completely.

### Step 3

Preheat the oven to 425°F.

### Step 4

Line the crust with aluminum foil and fill it with pie weights, uncooked rice, or dried beans. Place the crust on the
lower rack of the oven and bake it for 15 minutes. Remove the weights and foil. Brush the crust with a slightly beaten
egg yolk. Bake it for another 5 minutes. Allow the crust to cool completely on a wire rack.

### Step 5

Lower the oven heat to 350°F and make the topping. Whisk together the all-purpose flour, brown sugar, baking soda, and
salt until well combined. Using a pastry cutter or fork, cut in the butter cubes until the mixture is crumbly.

### Step 6

Pour the pie filling into the crust and sprinkle with the crumble topping. Cover the pie with aluminum foil and bake it
for 45 to 50 minutes, or until the filling has set and is golden brown. Cool it completely on a wire rack, for about 2
hours. Slice, serve, and enjoy!
