## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Pulse the all-purpose flour, 2 teaspoons of the granulated sugar, 1/2 teaspoon of the salt, and 1/2 cup of the salted
butter pieces in a food processor until the mixture resembles coarse sand.

### Step 2

While pulsing, add the ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time, through the food chute, just until the mixture can be pressed
together with your fingertips.

### Step 3

Form the dough into a disk and wrap it with plastic wrap.

### Step 4

Chill the dough for 1 hour.

### Step 5

Preheat the oven to 400°F.

### Step 6

Unwrap the dough and roll it into a 12-inch circle on a lightly floured surface.

### Step 7

Fit the pie crust dough into a 9-inch pie pan and trim the edges so that only 1/2-inch extends over the edge.

### Step 8

Fold the edges under and crimp.

### Step 9

Freeze the pie crust for 15 minutes.

### Step 10

Line the pie crust with parchment paper and fill it completely with pie weights or dried beans.

### Step 11

Bake the pie crust until it is set and the edge is light brown, about 15 minutes.

### Step 12

Transfer the pie crust from the oven and remove the pie weights from the crust.

### Step 13

Bake the pie crust again until it is golden-brown, about 15 minutes.

### Step 14

Allow the pie crust to cool completely on a wire rack, about 1 hour.

### Step 15

Combine the remaining granulated sugar and the water in a medium saucepan, bring the mixture to a boil over high heat,
and cook, without stirring, until the mixture is a deep amber color, about 9 minutes.

### Step 16

Transfer the mixture from the heat, protecting yourself from the steam, and gradually whisk in 1 cup of the heavy cream
until it is smooth.

### Step 17

Whisk 1 tablespoon of the rye whiskey and 1/4 teaspoon of the salt into the heavy cream mixture.

### Step 18

Cool the mixture at room temperature for 30 minutes and then store it in the refrigerator until ready to use.

### Step 19

Whisk the egg yolks, the cornstarch, and 1/4 cup of the half-and-half in a medium bowl.

### Step 20

Stir the light brown sugar, the remaining salt, and the remaining half-and-half in a large saucepan and bring to a boil
over medium-high heat.

### Step 21

Slowly whisk the hot brown sugar mixture into the egg yolk mixture and then return the mixture to the saucepan.

### Step 22

Cook the mixture over medium-high heat, whisking constantly and ensuring the mixture at the bottom of the saucepan is
whisked, until the mixture comes to a boil.

### Step 23

Boil, whisking the mixture constantly, for 1 minute.

### Step 24

Transfer the saucepan from the heat and whisk in the remaining salted butter, the remaining rye whiskey, and the
vanilla.

### Step 25

Let the mixture cool for 30 minutes.

### Step 26

Spoon the filling into the cooled pie crust.

### Step 27

Chill the pie in the refrigerator until the filling is firm and cold, about 4 hours.

### Step 28

About 1 hour before serving, beat the remaining heavy cream and the confectioners' sugar with an electric mixer on high
speed until stiff peaks form, about 3 to 5 minutes.

### Step 29

Spread the whipped cream over the pie filling and chill for 1 hour.

### Step 30

Drizzle the caramel sauce over the pie.

### Step 31

Serve.
