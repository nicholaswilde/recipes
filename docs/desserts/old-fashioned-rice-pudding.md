### Step 1

In a large saucepan, combine 5 1/2 cups milk, granulated sugar, and salt. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat.

### Step 2

Stir in long grain white rice and reduce heat to low. Be sure to adjust the heat so that it is at a gentle simmer.

### Step 3

Stirring occasionally, cook for 50 to 60 minutes. Mixture should thicken up to consistency of yogurt.

### Step 4

Once thickened, remove from heat and stir in vanilla.

### Step 5

Let cool and then refrigerate. The last 1/2 cup milk is stirred in just before serving. Sprinkle with cinnamon
(optional) if desired.
