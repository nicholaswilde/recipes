## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

In a small pot, simmer heavy cream, whole milk, granulated sugar, and salt until sugar completely dissolves, about 5
minutes. Remove pot from heat.

### Step 2

In a separate bowl, whisk egg yolks. Whisking constantly, slowly whisk about a third of the hot cream into the yolks,
then whisk the mixture back into the pot with the cream.

### Step 3

Return pot to medium-low heat and gently cook until mixture is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon (about 170°F on
an instant-read thermometer).

### Step 4

Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl. Cool mixture to room temperature by spreading into a rimmed baking sheet.
Place in a zip-top bag and chill at least 4 hours or overnight.

### Step 5

After freezing, you’ll have a sheet of frozen ice cream base that you can break or cut into chunks to fit inside your
food processor. Then you pulse the frozen base in a food processor before freezing again overnight.
