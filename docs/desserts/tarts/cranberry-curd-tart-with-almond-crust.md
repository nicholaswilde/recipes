!!! note

    You'll need a 9-inch tart pan with a removable bottom for this recipe. We strongly recommend weighing the almond
    flour and cornstarch for the crust. If preferred, you can use a stand mixer or handheld mixer to whip the cream in
    step 4. The tart crust will be firm if you serve the tart on the day that it's made; if you prefer a more tender
    crust, make the tart through step 3 up to two days ahead. For tips on how to pipe the whipped cream into decorative
    patterns, see note.

### Step 1

Bring cranberries, 1.25 cups granulated sugar, water, and salt to boil in medium saucepan over medium-high heat,
stirring occasionally. Adjust heat to maintain very gentle simmer. Cover and cook until all cranberries have burst and
started to shrivel, about 10 minutes. While cranberries cook, whisk egg yolks and cornstarch in bowl until smooth.
Transfer hot cranberry mixture to food processor. Immediately add yolk mixture and process until smooth (small flecks of
cranberry skin will be visible), about 1 minute, scraping down sides of bowl as necessary. Let mixture cool in processor
bowl until skin forms and mixture registers 120 to 125°F, 45 minutes to 1 hour. While mixture cools, make crust.

### Step 2

Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350°F. Whisk [almond flour][2], cornstarch, granulated sugar, and salt
in bowl until well combined. Add melted butter and almond extract and stir with wooden spoon until uniform dough forms.
Crumble two-thirds of mixture over bottom of 9 inch tart pan with removable bottom. Press dough to even thickness in
bottom of pan. Crumble remaining dough and scatter evenly around edge of pan. Press crumbled dough into sides of pan.
Press edges to even thickness. Place pan on rimmed baking sheet and bake until crust is golden brown, about 20 minutes,
rotating pan halfway through baking.

### Step 3

Add softened butter to cranberry puree and process until fully combined, about 30 seconds. Strain mixture through
fine-mesh strainer set over bowl, pressing on solids with rubber spatula to extract puree. Transfer 2 tablespoons puree
to medium bowl, then stir in heavy cream and remaining 1 tablespoon sugar. Cover and refrigerate. Transfer remaining
puree to crust (it's OK if crust is still warm) and smooth into even layer. Let tart sit at room temperature for at
least 4 hours. (Cover tart with large bowl and refrigerate after 4 hours if making ahead.)

### Step 4

Whisk cream mixture until stiff peaks form, 1 to 3 minutes. Transfer to pastry bag fitted with pastry tip. Pipe
decorative border around edge of tart. Transfer any remaining whipped cream to small serving bowl.
