## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat oven to 350°F (176°C) and line a baking dish with parchment paper. This recipe will make one 8x8-inch square,
one 9-inch circle, or two 6-inch rounds (adjust if altering batch size).

### Step 2

Make strawberry purée by blending fresh strawberries (160 g) until smooth.

### Step 3

To a large mixing bowl, add strawberry purée, vegetable oil, sugar, and vanilla. Whisk to combine.

### Step 4

Add all-purpose flour, baking powder, and salt to the wet ingredients and mix until fully incorporated with no lumps
remaining. The texture should be thick, like cornbread batter.

### Step 5

Pour the batter into your prepared baking dish, spread into an even layer, and bake on the center rack for 25 to 30
minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. The center of the cake should be firm but springy
when touched and the edges slightly golden brown.

### Step 6

Let your cake cool in the pan for 10 minutes before carefully turning it out onto a cooling rack.

### Step 7

Once your cake is completely cool, you can top it with vegan strawberry frosting, vanilla frosting, or a chocolate
ganache!

### Step 8

Best enjoyed the first day but will last, covered, at room temperature up to 3 days. Freeze up to 1 month (then thaw at
room temperature).
