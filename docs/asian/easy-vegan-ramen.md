## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Heat a large pot over medium-high heat.

### Step 2

Once hot, add olive oil, garlic, ginger, and yellow onion. Sauté, stirring occasionally for 5 to 8 minutes or until the
onion has developed a slight sear (browned edges).

### Step 3

Add 1 cup (240 ml // amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) of the vegetable broth to
deglaze the bottom of the pan. Use a whisk (or wooden spoon) to scrape up any bits that may have stuck to the bottom to
enhance the flavor of the broth.

### Step 4

Add remaining 5 cups (1200 ml // amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) vegetable broth,
tamari or soy sauce, and dehydrated shiitake mushrooms - stir.

### Step 5

Bring to a simmer over medium heat, then reduce heat to low and cover. Simmer on low for at least 1 hour, up to 2 to 3,
stirring occasionally. The longer it cooks, the more the flavor will deepen and develop.

### Step 6

Taste broth and adjust seasonings as needed, adding more soy sauce or sesame oil if desired. Add the white or yellow
miso paste at this time.

### Step 7

When you’re 30 minutes from serving, prepare any desired toppings (see notes for miso-glazed carrots (optional),
miso-glazed baby bok choy (optional), and quick-seared extra-firm tofu).

### Step 8 - Noodles

Fill a large saucepan or pot with water and bring to a boil. Once boiling, add ramen noodles (depending on size
of pan you may need to do this in two batches // use fewer or more batches if altering batch size) and cook according to
package instructions – about 4 to 5 minutes. Drain and set aside.

### Step 9

Strain broth and reserve mushrooms for serving. (Save onions and ginger for serving as well, if desired, though I
discarded them).

### Step 10

To serve, divide ramen noodles between four (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size)
serving bowls. Top with strained broth and desired toppings, such as carrots, bok choy, chopped green onion (optional),
or seared tofu. Serve with chili garlic sauce (optional (found here) for added heat.

### Step 11

Best when fresh, though the broth can be stored (separately) in the refrigerator for up to 5 days and in the freezer for
up to 1 month.
