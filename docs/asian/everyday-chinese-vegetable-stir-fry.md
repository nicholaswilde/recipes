### Step 1

In a liquid measuring cup, combine the vegetable stock, Shaoxing wine, oyster sauce, salt, sugar, sesame oil, and white
pepper.

### Step 2

In a wok over medium heat, add the vegetable oil and ginger. Cook until the ginger is lightly browned at the edges, and
then add the sliced mushrooms. Stir-fry for 1 to 2 minutes, until the mushrooms are tender.

### Step 3

Add the carrot, celery, asparagus, bell pepper, and long hot pepper. Stir-fry for 1 minute, and then add the garlic and
the seasoning mixture you prepared earlier. Bring the mixture to a simmer, and cook for 1 minute, until the vegetables

coated in sauce, with just a small amount of standing liquid. Serve.
