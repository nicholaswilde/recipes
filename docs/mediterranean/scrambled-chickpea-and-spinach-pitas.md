## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Add half of the chickpeas to a food processor fitted with the blade attachment
and pulse until broken down but not puréed. (Alternatively, place in a large
bowl and mash with a fork.) Set aside.

### Step 2

Heat the coconut oil in a 12-inch (or larger), high-sided skillet over medium
heat until shimmering. Add the onions, stir to coat with the oil, and cook until
soft, 4 to 5 minutes. Stir in the bell peppers, cumin, turmeric, garlic powder,
and salt, and cook until the peppers are tender, about 4 minutes.

### Step 3

Add the mashed and whole chickpeas, stir to combine, and cook until they begin
to soften, about 5 minutes. Stir in the spinach, cooking just until wilted,
about 3 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat.

### Step 4

To serve immediately, divide the chickpea mixture between the pitas, filling
each half with 3/4 to 1 cup of the mixture.

### Step 5

If not serving immediately, let the chickpea mixture cool completely before
filling, then wrap each pita half tightly in aluminum foil. Refrigerate or
freeze in resealable plastic bags. Reheat uncovered in a 325°F regular or
toaster oven until warmed through, about 20 minutes if refrigerated or about
30 minutes if frozen.
