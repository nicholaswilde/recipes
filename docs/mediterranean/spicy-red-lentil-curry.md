## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Thoroughly rinse dry red lentils in a fine mesh strainer and set aside. If serving with brown rice (optional), cook at
this time.

### Step 2

Heat a large rimmed skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add coconut oil, garlic, ginger, and carrots. Sauté for 2
minutes, stirring frequently.

### Step 3

Add red curry paste and sauté for 2 minutes, stirring frequently.

### Step 4

Add tomato paste, vegetable broth, water and stir to combine. Then add lentils, maple syrup, turmeric, and stir.

### Step 5

Bring to a simmer over medium heat, then reduce heat slightly to low (or medium-low), and gently simmer for 20 minutes,
or until lentils are tender. Stir frequently to incorporate flavors, and add more vegetable broth as needed if the
mixture becomes too thick.

### Step 6

An optional (but recommended) step: stir in coconut milk (optional) for additional creaminess, and to balance the heat
of the curry paste.

### Step 7

Taste and adjust seasonings as needed, adding more turmeric for depth of flavor, coconut sugar for sweetness/flavor
balance, or a pinch of salt for saltiness.

### Step 8

To serve, divide brown rice (optional) and lentils between 2-3 (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if
altering batch size) serving bowls and garnish with cilantro (optional), pickled red onions (optional), and pita or naan
(optional) for dipping.

### Step 9

Store leftovers separately in the refrigerator for up to 4 days. Reheat on the stovetop, adding water as needed for
moisture, or in the microwave.
