## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

In a heavy-bottomed soup pot, heat 2 Tbsp of olive oil over medium-high heat until it shimmers. Add the button or
cremini mushrooms and stir well; saute until they give up their liquid and begin to brown a bit, about 10 minutes. Add
the diced onion, peeled and diced carrot, diced celery, chopped garlic, red pepper flakes, oregano, thyme, bay leaves,
finely chopped walnuts, and salt, and stir well to combine. Continue sauteing until the vegetables soften and begin to
color, another 10 minutes or so.

### Step 2

Add the red wine and stir, scraping up any brown bits off the bottom of the pot. Then add the crushed or pureed
tomatoes, liquid aminos or fish sauce, and unsweetened soy milk, and stir well. Lower the heat to a bare simmer and let
the sauce cook, stirring occasionally to be sure it isn't sticking, for an hour. If the sauce starts to stick, add 1/4
cup of water and stir  well. Let it continue simmering for a least another 40 minutes or up to 4 hours for deeper
flavors. Remove the bay leaves.

### Step 3

Add the durum wheat spaghetti pasta to the pot and stir well. Add the remaining 1/4 cup of oil and the nutritional yeast
or pecorino, stir again, and add a ladle of pasta water if the sauce needs to be thinned out.

### Step 4

Serve immediately, topping each mound of pasta with a little extra sauce from the pot, the torn basil leaves, and a
sprinkling of nutritional yeast or pecorino if desired.
