!!! note
    Be sure to set up the ice bath before cooking the wax and Romano beans, as plunging them in the cold water immediately
    after blanching them retains their bright colors and ensures that they don't overcook.

### Step 1

Whisk cider vinegar, olive oil, honey, minced garlic, salt, and pepper together in large bowl. Stir in thinly sliced red
onion and set aside.

### Step 2

Bring 4 quarts water to boil in large pot over high heat. Fill large bowl halfway with ice and water. Add trimmed and
halved on bias yellow wax beans, trimmed and halved on bias Romano beans, and 1 tablespoon salt to boiling water and
cook until crisp-tender, 3 to 5 minutes. Drain beans, then transfer immediately to ice bath. Let beans cool completely,
about 5 minutes, then drain again and pat dry with paper towels.

### Step 3

Add wax and Romano beans, kidney beans, and minced fresh parsley to vinaigrette and toss to coat. Season with salt and
pepper to taste. Serve.
