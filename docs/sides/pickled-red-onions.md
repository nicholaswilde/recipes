## :salt: Ingredients

- 2 small red onions
- 2 cloves garlic
- 1 tsp mixed peppercorns
- 2 cups white vinegar

- 0.33 cup cane sugar

- 1 mandoline
- 2 16-ounce jars
- 1 medium saucepan

## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Thinly slice the red onions (it's helpful to use a mandoline), and divide the onions between 2 16-ounce jars or 3
(10-ounce) jars. Place the garlic and mixed peppercorns in each jar, if using.

### Step 2

Heat the white vinegar, water, cane sugar, and sea salt in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Stir until the sugar and
salt dissolve, about 1 minute. Let cool and pour over the onions. Set aside to cool to room temperature, then store the
onions in the fridge.

### Step 3

Your pickled onions will be ready to eat once they're bright pink and tender - about 1 hour for very thinly sliced
onions, or overnight for thicker sliced onions. They will keep in the fridge for up to 2 weeks.
