## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Pour heavy cream and half-and-half into a saucepan.

### Step 2

Stir in garlic (pureed), salt, white pepper (several grinds), and the bay leaf.

### Step 3

Slice potatoes evenly 1/8 inch thick, dropping them as sliced into the cream. When all are in, add more cream if necessary, to cover the potatoes by 0.5 inch.

### Step 4

Bring to below the simmer and maintain at just below the simmer for 1 hour or more, until the potatoes are perfectly tender. Check frequently to be sure they are not bubbling, since that can cause the cream to curdle; check also that the potatoes are not sticking or scorching in the bottom of the pan.

### Step 5

When tender, correct seasoning and turn them into a buttered baking and serving dish; spread on the grated Swiss cheese.

!!! tip
    May be prepared to this point several hours in advance. Cover when cool, and refrigerate.

### Step 6

About 20 minutes before serving, set in the upper middle level of the preheated oven at 425°F and bake until bubbling hot and lightly browned on top: do not overcook or the potatoes will be dry rather than lush and creamy.
