## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Heat the oven (with the oven rack in the middle) to 425°F.

### Step 2

Peel the thin carrots. If they are longer than 7 inches, cut them in half crosswise. If they are thicker than 3/4 inch,
cut them in half lengthwise. Otherwise, leave them whole.

### Step 3

Put the carrots on a rimmed sheet pan. Drizzle with the olive oil and, using your hands, toss them together to coat.

### Step 4

In a small bowl, stir together the dark brown sugar, paprika, cumin, salt, black pepper, and cayenne. Sprinkle over the
carrots and toss again. Spread in a single layer and roast for 25 to 30 minutes, shaking the pan half-way through, until
the carrots are tender. They will be candied and a little burnt in spots.

### Step 5

Sprinkle with dill and serve.
