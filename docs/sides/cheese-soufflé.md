## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Mix 3.5 tablespoons (49 g) of unsalted butter and all-purpose flour to make a paste called beurre manie. Chill to firm for 30
minutes. Heat milk to boil add the onion, star anise, cloves and bay leaf, reduce to simmer for 5 minutes. Remove from
heat, let cool. Taste test for flavor.

### Step 2

Strain the milk into a pan then press down on the onion to extract the maximum flavor. Place pan back on heat and
gradually whisk in the butter paste, adding in small pieces until it thickens. Season then let cool 3 to 4 minutes.
Whisk egg yolks with grated Gruyère and mature cheddar plus two thirds of the Parmesan. Add in the Worcestershire sauce
and mustard powder. Bring to room temperature before continuing.

### Step 3

Brush a soufflé dish (7"  x 3") with remaining 2 tablespoons of butter using upward strokes. Coat base and sides with
remaining Parmesan cheese and freshly ground black pepper. Chill to set. Cut Gruyère into diamond shapes.

### Step 4

Preheat oven to 400°F / 200°C. Coat a large grease-free bowl with the lemon juice. Whisk your egg whites in the bowl,
then whisk one third of them into the cheese mixture, to loosen. Carefully, fold the remaining egg whites into the
cheese mixture until well blended, but still light.

### Step 5

Spoon half of the mixture into the prepared soufflé dish and dot with the ripe Brie pieces then top with the remaining
mixture. Gently level off the top. Bake 10 minutes then reduce oven temperature to 365°F / 185°C and bake another 15
to 20 minutes. Soufflé should evenly rise and be slightly wobbly. Serve immediately.
