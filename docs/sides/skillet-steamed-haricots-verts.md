- 12 oz haricots verts
- :ice_cube: 0.25 cup water

## :pencil: Instructions

!!! note
    We developed this recipe with beans that were about 1/4 inch wide. If your haricots verts are skinnier, decrease the
    water to 3 tablespoons and decrease the covered cooking time to 2 minutes.

### Step 2

Arrange haricots verts in even layer in 12-inch skillet. Add water and sprinkle evenly with salt. Cook over medium-high
heat until water is sizzling. Cover and continue to cook until beans are bright green and crisp tender, about 3 minutes
longer, tossing beans twice during cooking. Reduce heat to medium. Add unsalted butter and minced shallot and continue
to cook, uncovered, tossing beans frequently, until water has evaporated, about 1 minute longer. Season with salt to
taste, and serve.
