# :corn: Kettle Corn

![Kettle Corn](../assets/images/kettle-corn.png)

| :timer_clock: Total Time |
|:-----------------------: |
| 4 minutes |

## :salt: Ingredients

- :oil_drum: 0.25 cup vegetable oil
- :corn: 0.25 cup kernels
- :candy: 2 Tbsp sugar
- :salt: 0.5 tsp salt

!!! note

    To double the recipe for 12 to 14 cups of popcorn, use the same amount of oil, 1/2 cup of corn kernels, 1/4 cup of
    granulated sugar, and 3/4 to 1 teaspoon of salt.

## :cooking: Cookware

- 1 large (6-quart) soup pot
- 1 wooden spoon

## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Gather the ingredients.

### Step 2

Put the vegetable oil and 3 kernels of popcorn in a large (6-quart) soup pot, cover, and set over medium heat until you
hear the kernels pop, about 1 minute.

### Step 3

As soon as you hear the kernels pop, add the remaining popcorn kernels and sugar. Stir once or twice with a wooden
spoon.

### Step 4

Cover the pot. Slip on oven mitts and cook, swirling the pan constantly, until the popping slows to about 2 seconds
apart, about 1.5 minutes. Slide the pot off of the heat and let it stand, covered, until the popping stops, about 5
seconds.

### Step 5

Sprinkle the popcorn with salt, cover, and shake the pot to combine everything evenly. Pour the kettle corn out into a
large, wide bowl immediately. Let the popcorn cool for 2 minutes so it crisps up before serving.

## :zap: Variations

- Substitute light brown sugar for white sugar for a more caramelized flavor.
- Substitute truffle salt, smoked salt, Old Bay seasoning, or garlic salt for the regular salt for a sweet and savory
  flavor.
- Add a dash of chili powder to the kettle corn along with the salt.
- For a warm spice flavor, add 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon of ground cinnamon or pumpkin pie spice to the kettle corn along
  with the salt.
