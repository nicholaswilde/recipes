## :pencil: Instructions

!!! note
    These mushrooms make a great accompaniment to other grilled foods. Use any mix of mushrooms you like, as long as
    the caps measure at least 2 inches in diameter. See "Get Mushrooms Grill Ready" for mushroom prep instructions.
    A grill basket is helpful here but not essential. The parcooked mushrooms can be refrigerated for up to 24 hours.

### Step 1

Combine mushrooms (at least 2 inch wide) and 1/2 cup water in bowl. Cover and microwave for 1 minute. Stir well;
re-cover; and microwave until mushrooms have reduced in size by about one-third and liquid has increased to almost 1
cup, about 2 minutes. Remove from microwave and let rest, covered, for 5 minutes to finish cooking. Drain well. Dry bowl
and return mushrooms to bowl. Let stand at room temperature while preparing grill.

### Step 2A

FOR A CHARCOAL GRILL: Open bottom vent completely. Light large chimney starter three-quarters filled with charcoal
briquettes (about 42 quarts). When top coals are partially covered with ash, pour evenly over half of grill. Set cooking
grate in place, cover, and open lid vent completely. Heat grill until hot, about 5 minutes.

### Step 2B

FOR A GAS GRILL: Turn all burners to high; cover; and heat grill until hot, about 15 minutes. Leave primary burner on
high and turn off other burner(s).

### Step 3

Clean and oil cooking grate. Toss mushrooms with vegetable oil, pepper, and salt. Arrange mushrooms on hotter side of
grill. Cook (covered if using gas), flipping mushrooms every 2 minutes, until well browned on all sides, 4 to 6 minutes.
Carefully brush mushrooms with half of garlic-parsley or ginger-miso basting butter and continue to cook until butter is
sizzling and fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes longer. Transfer to bowl with remaining basting butter and toss to combine. Season
with salt and pepper to taste, and serve.
