## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat oven to 350°F. Place the Brie into a cast iron skillet, casserole dish, or pie plate. Place into the oven and
bake for 5 to 15 minutes, until softened but not completely melted.

### Step 2

Toast the walnuts on the range in a skillet.

### Step 3

Meanwhile, combine honey, toasted walnuts, rosemary, and dried cherries or cranberries (optional). Stir until completely
combined. If your honey is really thick you can place it in the microwave for a few seconds to thin it out a bit. Don't
microwave it too long or it will become really thin.

### Step 4

Once the Brie is done, sprinkle it with a little salt, then spoon over the honey mixture and sprinkle with a little more
sea salt. Serve immediately with toasted bread (alternative), crackers and fruit (alternative).
