## :pencil: Instructions

!!! note
    Pectin is a natural fiber found in most plants. Fruits like apples and oranges are particularly high in pectin,
    with the highest concentrations in the skins, cores and seeds.

### Step 1

In a saucepan, boil two pounds of tart green apples (slightly under-ripe apples work best) with four cups of water and
one tablespoon of lemon juice for 30 minutes, then strain through cheesecloth

### Step 2

Boil further to reduce the volume by half will result in an effective homemade liquid pectin.

!!! info

    See [Equivalents & Substitutes][1] for dry to liquid pectin conversion.
