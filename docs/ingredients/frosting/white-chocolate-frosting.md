let the chocolate cool.

### Step 2

Place the room temperature cream cheese and room temperature unsalted butter in a large mixing bowl. Beat with an
electric mixer on low speed until well combined, about 30 seconds. Stop the machine. Add the melted white chocolate and
blend on low for 30 seconds. Add the vanilla and confectioners' sugar and blend on low speed for 30 seconds more.
Increase the mixer speed to medium and beat until the frosting is fluffy, about 1 minute.
