## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Before you begin, place your cake or cupcakes in the freezer to chill while you prepare the poured fondant.

### Step 2

In a saucepan set over low heat, or in the microwave, melt the white chocolate chips (or white confectioners' coating),
stirring until smooth.

### Step 3

Sift the confectioners' sugar into a large bowl, and add the light corn syrup and hot water, stirring until smooth. If
you're using a mixer, set it on low speed so the icing doesn't become too aerated.

### Step 4

Add the melted coating to the sugar mixture, then add the vanilla extract and natural food coloring. Transfer to a
heat-proof liquid measuring cup. At this point, the fondant should easily pour off your spoon or spatula; if it's too
thick, reheat it briefly in the microwave in 30 seconds bursts, and stir in 1 to 3 tablespoons additional water until it
flows. The mixture is easiest to work with and pours smoothly at about 100°F.

### Step 5

Remove the cake(s) from the freezer. Place on a wire rack on top of a rimmed baking sheet lined with parchment. Pour the
fondant over the cake(s), starting in the center and working toward the edges. Encourage the fondant to drip over the
sides until entirely covered. Allow the fondant to settle for about 1 minute, then use the parchment to transfer the
excess fondant that dripped off the cake into a fine-mesh strainer placed over a heat-proof bowl. Reheat the fondant
until it's 100°F and repeat the process until the cakes are fully coated.

### Step 6

Allow the cake(s) to set for about 45 minutes to 1 hour; the poured fondant should feel dry to the touch. Use a sharp
knife or small offset spatula to carefully remove the cake(s) from the wire rack. Add any additional decoration, if
desired. Transfer to a plate for serving.
