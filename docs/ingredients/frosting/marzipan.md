## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Put ground almonds, granulated sugar, confectioners' sugar, and almond essence (optional) into a food processor and
pulse until the mixture comes together into a fine powder. Gently add the egg white and whiz the whole lot together
until it comes together.

### Step 2

Dust a work surface with some icing sugar, then tip the marzipan dough out. Gently bring it together with your hands
until it makes a smooth dough. You don’t want it to be sticky at this point, so you may need to add more icing sugar.

### Step 3

Then simply roll the marzipan out; ready to cover your cake.
