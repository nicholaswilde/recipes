## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Add vanilla to heavy cream so that it is ready to go.

### Step 2

Put granulated sugar and water in large heavy bottom saucepan and put on medium heat.

!!! warning

    Do not stir so that the mixture doesn't crystallize. If it does, just keep on medium-low heat.

### Step 3

If a bit of crystallization around the edge of the pan, take a silicone brush and dip in water and wipe away.

!!! note

    Can keep a lid on the pot to trap the steam to prevent crystallization.

### Step 4

Take pan off of heat once the caramel mixture turns to a nice amber color.

### Step 5

Stir in vanilla and cream mixture a little bit at a time to avoid splattering. Add more a little bit a time, like
tempering chocolate.

### Step 6

Pour into nice heat proof large bowl to let it cool.

### Step 7

Use it to drizzle or to flavor butter cream.

!!! warning

    Don't put caramel hot into the fridge to cool it down because it is going to bring the temperature of the fridge up
    and put other food in the danger zone.
