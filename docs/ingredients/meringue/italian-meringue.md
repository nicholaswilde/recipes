!!! note
    This classic Italian meringue does not require baking, because the egg whites are already cooked by the hot syrup.
    You may want to brown it lightly in a 350° oven. This meringue is not so stiff as Swiss or French.

### Step 1

Heat in a heavy pan and stir until dissolved 1/2 cup water, 1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar, and 1 cup sugar.

### Step 2

When the syrup is boiling cover and cook about 3 minutes or until the steam has washed down any crystals that may have
formed on the sides of the pan. Uncover and cook without stirring to 238° to 240°. Pour the syrup very gradually onto
3 well-beaten egg whites beating constantly, until this frosting meringue is cool and ready to be spread on the pie
filling or pudding.
