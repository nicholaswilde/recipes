| 1 9-in or 10-in double crust | 30 minutes |

## :salt: Ingredients

- :ear_of_rice: 450 g all-purpose flour
- :candy: 2 Tbsp granulated sugar
- :salt: 1 tsp salt
- :butter: 283 g (2.5 sticks) unsalted butter
- :droplet: 227 g ice water

## :cooking: Cookware

- 1 pastry blender
- 1 fork

## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, and salt.

### Step 2

Add the butter to the bowl with the dry ingredients and toss, separating the pieces and coating them in the flour
mixture. Use your fingertips to quickly break and smash the pieces of butter into smaller bits (it’s OK if some of the
butter is left in large pieces; you’ll break it up more in the next step). Make a well in the center of the bowl and add
2/3 cup (152g) of the ice water. Toss with a fork to distribute the water until you have a clumpy mixture with lots of 
dry spots. 

### Step 3

Tip the contents of the bowl out onto a clean work surface. Use a bench knife or bowl scraper to chop up the mixture,
breaking up the clumps and pieces of butter and periodically using the scraper to toss and push the mixture back into a
pile. Continue to chop and toss the mixture until it’s broken down into small, uniform pieces with very few floury spots 
and the butter pieces are no larger than a pea. This process helps bring the dough together without working it
excessively, increasing tenderness. 

### Step 4

Push the mixture into a pile and squeeze it with your hands so it holds together in large pieces. If you still have some
dry floury areas, move any large pieces to one side, leaving the dry bits in the pile. Drizzle 1/2 tablespoon of ice
water over the floury area, then use the bench knife or bowl scraper in the same chopping motion to evenly distribute
the water. Squeeze the dough to bring it together, move the large pieces to the side, then repeat with more ice water as
needed until no dry flour remains on the surface.  

### Step 5

Use your hands to pat the dough firmly into a square, then use a floured rolling pin to flatten the square until it’s
3/4" thick. Pat around the four sides with your hands or the scraper to square off and compact the dough then cut it in
half.

### Step 6

Lift one half up (again, using the scraper to help) and place it directly on top of the other. Use the scraper to lift
the stack of dough and dust underneath with more flour, then roll over it with the pin to flatten and lengthen it
slightly, dusting the top with flour if needed to prevent sticking. Cut the dough in half again, this time crosswise,
and stack the halves again. The stacking and flattening increases the flakiness of the dough and further distributes the
moisture, making it easier to roll out.

### Step 7

Working quickly, use the scraper to loosen the dough from the surface and dust underneath and on top with more flour,
then flatten it with the rolling pin into a long rectangle measuring 3/4" thick.  

### Step 8

If making the Walnut & Oat Slab Pie leave the rectangle whole. If making a round pie, cut the rectangle in half
crosswise to make 2 equal portions. Whatever form the dough takes when it’s chilled is the form it will most easily
assume when being rolled out, so if it’s destined to be round, as for a pie, use the heel of your hand to round off any
corners and press the portion(s) into more of a disk shape. If it’s destined to be rectangular, pat around the sides to
straighten and square off the corners.  

### Step 9

Wrap each piece in your favorite reusable wrapper, maintaining the round or rectangular shape. Roll over the wrapped
pieces with the rolling pin to flatten the dough and force it to fill out the wrap (applying this pressure will help
prevent cracking later). 

### Step 10

Transfer the dough to the refrigerator and chill until it’s very cold and firm, at least 2 hours. If a recipe requires a
single portion of dough, freeze the other portion and save it for another use.  

### Step 11

To roll out the chilled pastry dough: Remove the cold pastry dough from the refrigerator and let it sit at room
temperature for a minute or two to soften slightly. Unwrap the dough and place it on a lightly floured surface.

### Step 12

Use a rolling pin to beat the dough evenly across the surface, applying enough force to leave an imprint but not enough 
to crack or splinter it. If rolling it into a round, lift and rotate the dough every couple of whacks to keep the round 
shape. If rolling it into a square or rectangle, beat the dough lengthwise across the entire surface, then rotate it 90°
(a quarter turn) and beat crosswise, repeating several times in both directions. Continue to beat the dough, lifting it
frequently and adding more flour if needed to prevent sticking, until it’s just under 1/2" thick. This will make the
dough pliable and easier to roll out while still cold. 

### Step 13

Dust underneath and on top of the dough with more flour, then roll it out, frequently lifting and rotating the dough to 
work it into a round, or turning it 90° every so often and rolling it lengthwise and crosswise for a square or
rectangle. Continue to roll, keeping the dough moving on the work surface and dusting it with more flour as needed to
prevent sticking, until you have the size and/or thickness specified in the recipe. If it starts to feel soft or sticky,
transfer the dough to a baking sheet and refrigerate until it’s cold and firm, about 10 minutes, then proceed.

!!! note

    Store unbaked pastry dough, well-wrapped, in the refrigerator for 2 days or in the freezer for up to 2 months.
