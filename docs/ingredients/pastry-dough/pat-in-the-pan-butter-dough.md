|:----------------------------------:|:-----------------------: |
| 1 9 inch pie crust | 0 minutes |

## :salt: Ingredients

- :ear_of_rice: 0.5 cup all-purpose flour
- :salt: 0.5 tsp salt
- :butter: 0.5 cup unsalted butter
- :glass_of_milk: 3 Tbsp heavy cream

## :cooking: Cookware

- 1 bowl
- 1 food processor

## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Whisk together in a bowl or process in a food processor for 10 seconds 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, 1/2 teaspoon salt

### Step 2

Add 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, cut into 8 pieces, softened.

### Step 3

Mash with the back of a fork or process until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.

### Step 4

Drizzle over the top 2 to 3 tablespoons heavy cream.

### Step 5

Stir or process until the crumbs look damp and hold together when pinched.

### Step 6

To shape the crust for a pie or tart, pat the dough evenly over the bottom and up the sides of a 9-inch pie pan or a
9 or 10 inch two-piece tart pan, or roll it with a rolling pin between sheets of wax paper and flip it into the pan.
If making a pie, crimp or flute the rim. To bake, thoroughly prick the sides and bottom of the crust with a fork. Bake
in a preheated 425°F oven (400°F for shortbread) until the crust is golden brown, 18 to 22 minutes, pricking the
bottom once or twice if it bubbles. If you will be filling the crust with an uncooked mixture that requires further
baking, whisk together 1 large egg yolk and a pinch of salt, and brush the warm crust with this glaze, then return
to the oven and bake until the glaze sets, 1 to 2 minutes.

### Step 7

This dough will also make eight 3/2-inch tartlet crusts. For tartlets, divide the dough into 8 pieces and into molds
or shape over inverted muffin tins. If baking press "blind," without a filling, bake at 450°F until firm and it
golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes, pricking the crusts once or twice if they bubble.
