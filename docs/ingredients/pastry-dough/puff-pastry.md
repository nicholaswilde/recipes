## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Put the chilled strong white bread flour, chilled plain flour, salt, eggs, and cold water into a large bowl and gently
mix to an even dough with your fingers. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead it for 5 to 10 minutes
until smooth. The dough should feel a little tight at this stage. Shape the dough into a ball and put it into a plastic
bag in the fridge to chill overnight, or for at least 7 hours.

### Step 2

Flatten the chilled unsalted butter into a rectangle, about 40 x 19cm, by battering it down with your rolling pin. (You
may find this easier to do this if you sandwich the butter between 2 sheets of cling film). Return to the fridge for 1
hour to harden the butter again.

### Step 3

Roll out your dough to a rectangle, about 60 x 20cm wide. Put the butter on the dough so it covers the bottom
two-thirds. Make sure that it is positioned neatly and covers almost to the edges.

### Step 4

Lift the exposed dough at the top and fold it down over half of the butter, then fold the butter-covered bottom half of
the dough up over the top. You will now have a sandwich of two layers of butter and three of dough. Pinch the edges
together to seal. Put it back in a plastic bag and chill for 1 hour.

### Step 5

Take the dough out of the bag and put it on a lightly floured surface with a short end towards you. Roll out to a
rectangle as before, keeping the edges as even as possible. Fold the top quarter down and the bottom quarter up so they
meet neatly in the center. Then fold the dough in half along the center line. This is called a book turn. Chill in the
bag for 1 hour.

### Step 6

Take the dough out of the bag, put it on a lightly floured surface with the short end towards you and roll into a
rectangle as before. This time, fold down one-third of the dough and then fold up the bottom third to make a neat
square. This is called a single turn. Chill in the bag for another hour.

### Step 7

Bring your dough out again and do a single turn as previously. Chill in the bag overnight. Your dough is now ready to
use.
