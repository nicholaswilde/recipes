## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Put all-purpose flour and strong white bread flour into a bowl. Add the cubed unsalted butter and rub in with your
fingertips.

### Step 2

!!! danger

    Melting vegetable shortening on the stovetop in water can cause the mixture to explode. Watch carefully and don't
    overcook.

Heat the vegetable shortening in a pan until melted. Dissolve the salt in the boiling water, then add to the melted
vegetable shortening.

### Step 3

Pour this liquid into the flour. Mix with a spoon then, as soon as it is cool enough, tip the dough onto a lightly
floured surface and work together into a ball. Be careful that the dough is not too hot when you start to work it.

### Step 4

Once the dough ball is formed, leave it to cool slightly. If it’s still lumpy, work it a minute or two longer.

### Step 5

Divide the dough in two, making one piece slightly bigger than the other.
