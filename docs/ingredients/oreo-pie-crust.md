## :salt: Ingredients

- 24 cookies Oreos
- 4 Tbsp butter

## :cooking: Cookware

- 1 food process
- 1 large bowl
- 1 9-inch ungreased pie plate

## :pencil: Instructions

!!! note
    This recipe works best with classic Oreo cookies. I suggest not using the Thins, Double Stuf, or Mega Stuf.

!!! note
    This crust recipe can be pressed into a 9 to 10-inch springform pan for a cheesecake crust as well.

### Step 1

Pulse the Oreos (filling included) in a food process or chopper until you get fine crumbs. Add the crumbs to a large
bowl. Add the melted butter and stir to ensure the crumbs are well coated.

### Step 2

Pour the mixture into a 9-inch ungreased pie plate and carefully press the mixture evenly on the bottom and sides of the
pie plate. I like to use a 1/3 or 1/4 cup dry measuring cup to press it flat.

### Step 3

To set the crust, you can either bake it or refrigerate it. If I'm going to use it in a no-bake recipe, I just put it in
the refrigerator for about 30 minutes to allow the butter to harden and set the crust. Otherwise, you can bake it in a
350°F oven for 8 to 10 minutes, then allow it to cool completely before finishing your recipe.
