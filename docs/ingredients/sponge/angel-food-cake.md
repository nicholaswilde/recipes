## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 325°F. Don't grease or flour your angel food cake pan. A 10" round pan or an angel food loaf pan
will fit this recipe well.

### Step 2

In a large bowl, whisk together the cake flour and 3/4 cup of the granulated sugar. Set aside.

### Step 3

In a large mixing bowl, combine the egg whites, salt, and vanilla. Beat until the mixture is just frothy, then sprinkle
the cream of tartar on top and continue beating until the mixture forms stiff, glossy peaks.

### Step 4

Add the remaining sugar, 1/4 cup at a time, then gradually fold in the dry ingredients.

### Step 5

Spoon the batter into the pan, and bake the cake for 40 to 45 minutes, or until it's golden brown and the top springs
back when lightly touched.

### Step 6

Remove the cake from the oven, and set it upside down with a bottle through its center cone to keep its top from
flattening on the counter. Let the cake cool for 1.5 hours. This cooling period sets the structure, and keeps the cake
from collapsing.

### Step 7

Loosen the edges of the cake with a knife, and remove it from the pan.

### Step 8

Store the cake, covered, on the counter for up to a week. Freeze, well wrapped, for up to 3 months.
