| :timer_clock: Total Time |
|:-----------------------: |
| 2.52 hours |

## :salt: Ingredients

- :jack_o_lantern: 1 pumpkin or large squash (sugar pie pumpkin, butternut, buttercup or kabocha squash)

## :cooking: Cookware

- 1 baking sheet
- 1 parchment paper
- 1 food processor
- 1 fine mesh strainer or cheesecloth

## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 400°F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Slice the pumpkin or large squash (sugar pie
pumpkin, butternut, buttercup or kabocha squash) in half, scoop out the seeds and place cut side down on the baking
sheet.

### Step 2

Roast for 40 to 60 minutes or until the flesh is soft and a fork easily slides in. Let cool for about 1 hour. Use your
hands to peel the flesh from the skin and place in a food processor. Purée until smooth, letting your food processor
run for about 1 minute, stopping to scrape down the sides as needed. If your puree is more watery than the texture of
canned pumpkin, strain the excess liquid by letting it sit in a fine mesh strainer or cheesecloth over a bowl for 30
minutes.

### Step 3

Chill until ready to use.

!!! note

    Avoid large Halloween carving pumpkins because their flesh is too fibrous for a soft puree.
