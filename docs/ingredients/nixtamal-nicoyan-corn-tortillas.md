## :salt: Ingredients

- :corn: 2 cups masa harina
- :salt: 1 tsp salt
- :glass_with_straw: 0.25 tsp baking soda
- :hotsprings: 1.5 cups warm water

## :cooking: Cookware

- 1 large bowl
- 1 plastic wrap
- 1 griddle or skillet
- 1 kitchen tongs

## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Whisk the masa harina, salt, and baking soda in a large bowl. Add 1.5 cups warm water and stir until a soft dough forms.
If the mixture won’t form a soft ball of dough, add warm water in 1 tablespoon increments until it will. Cover with
plastic wrap and set aside for 5 minutes.

### Step 2

Turn the dough out onto a clean, dry work surface. Knead gently for 1 minute. Divide it into 16 equal pieces, each about
the size of a small plum.

### Step 3

To use a tortilla press, line the press with two small sheets of wax paper. Put one piece of dough between the sheets,
close the press, and gently press down. Remove the dough between the wax paper sheets, then repeat with more wax paper
and the remaining dough balls. To make tortillas by hand, put each dough ball between two pieces of wax paper and roll
it into a thin 6-inch round.

### Step 4

Set a griddle or skillet, preferably cast iron, over high heat until smoking. Remove one flattened dough ball from the
wax paper and set on the griddle or in the pan. Cook for 30 seconds, flip with kitchen tongs, and cook until lightly
toasted with tiny bubbles in the tortilla, about 30 seconds more. Transfer to a clean kitchen towel, wrap gently, and
continue cooking more tortillas, keeping them warm as a stack in the towel. Serve warm.
