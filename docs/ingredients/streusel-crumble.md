## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a sheet pan with parchment paper.

### Step 2

In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (or in a large bowl using a spatula), combine the all-purpose flour,
hazelnut flour, sugar, and fleur de sel. Add the butter and mix to combine. Using your fingers, break up the streusel
dough into pieces about the size of marbles. (Alternatively, push the dough through the holes of a wire rack to get
pieces of a more uniform size.)

### Step 3

Spread the streusel over the prepared pan and bake until golden, 10 to 12 minutes. The edges should be crunchy and the
inside still soft. Let cool completely.
