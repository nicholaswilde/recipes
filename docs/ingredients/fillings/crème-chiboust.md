# :custard: Crème Chiboust

![Crème Chiboust](../../assets/images/crème-chiboust.jpg)

| :timer_clock: Total Time |
|:-----------------------: |
| 30 minutes |

## :salt: Ingredients

- 7 g Gelatin (optional)

## :cooking: Cookware

- 1 bowl

## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Combine equal amounts of [crème pâtissière][1] and [italian meringue][2] by folding one third of the hot meringue into
the warm pastry cream and then the rest of the mergingue.

### Step 2

Gelatin may be added to the custard to thicken it.

!!! note

    Please remember that the Crème Chiboust is very delicate and can become "dangerous" since the pastry cream is
    left at room temperature for some time, during which bacteria could form in it.

!!! note

    To avoid risks while you prepare the meringue, you can cover the bowl with plastic film on the pastry cream and
    additionally you could also place temporarily the bowl on a bain-marie: this will keep the cream at safe
    temperatures and prevent the formation of bacteria.

!!! note

    If the cream needs to be baked (e.g. to fill tarts), you can omit the gelatin.

!!! note

    It might be necessary to let the cream set a few minutes in the fridge before it can used in a piping bag.
