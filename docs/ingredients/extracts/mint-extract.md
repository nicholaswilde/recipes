# :shamrock: Mint Extract

![Mint Extract](../../assets/images/mint-extract.jpg)

| :timer_clock: Total Time |
|:-----------------------: |
| 5-6 weeks |

## :salt: Ingredients

- :shamrock: 0.5 cup mint leaves
- :sake: 2 oz vodka

## :cooking: Cookware

- 1 2-fl. oz glass bottle
- 1 chopstick, skewer, or other poking device

## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Stuff mint leaves into your 2-fl. oz glass bottle.

### Step 2

Using a chopstick, skewer, or other poking device, lightly bruise/crush the leaves inside the bottle.

### Step 3

Add vodka, filling up to the neck of the bottle.

### Step 4

Every few days, tilt your bottle upside down to gently mix the liquid inside.

### Step 5

After 5-6 weeks, you have extract! (I’m not sure if, like vanilla extract, you can just leave the mint leaves inside.
Since it’s leafy plant matter which disintegrates more easily, it may be a good idea to take it out. My leaves went
from a vibrant green in the beginning to kind of a dull brown by the end so I took them out just to be safe – I poured
my mint extract into another container through a sieve and discarded the mint leaves, then poured the filtered extract
back into the bottle.)
