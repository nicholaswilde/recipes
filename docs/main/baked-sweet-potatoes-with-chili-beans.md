## :salt: Ingredients

- 4 small sweet potatoes
- 0.5 lb pinto beans
- 1 yellow onion
- 2 tsp olive oil
- 2 cloves garlic
- 1 Tbsp chili powder
- 1 tsp cumin
- 0.5 tsp paprika
- 1 tsp smoked salt
- 1 jar San Marzano tomatoes
- 1 avocado
- some sour cream
- some cilantro
- some shredded cheese
- 1 red onion

## :cooking: Cookware

- 1 foil,
- 1 pot

## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 400. Pierce holes in the sweet potatoes/yams, lightly wrap them in foil, and bake on the middle rack
for about 45 to 55 minutes.

### Step 2

Put the pinto beans in a pot and completely cover with water, plus 2 extra inches. Bring to a gentle boil and cook for
45 to 60 minutes until the beans are cooked through.

### Step 3

While the beans cook, thinly slice the yellow onion. Over medium heat, warm the olive oil in a heavy bottomed pot and
cook the onions and garlic until softened. Add chili powder, cumin, paprika, smoked salt, and the jar of San Marzano
tomatoes. If the tomatoes are crushed, great, if they are whole, just smush them to a puree. Bring to a simmer and
reduce for about 20 minutes while the beans finish cooking.

### Step 4

When the beans are cooked, drain and add them to the tomato mix, cook another 10 minutes for all the flavors to marry.
Taste for salt and spices, add more if desired.

### Step 5

Split open the baked sweet potato/yams and create a little cavern down the middle. Fill the cavern with the chili beans
and add toppings as desired. I like a bit of avocado, sour cream and cilantro. You could go with a bit of shredded
cheese and minced red onion... something tells me you've had chili before and know the drill.
