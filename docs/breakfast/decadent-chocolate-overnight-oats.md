## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

To a mason jar or small bowl with a lid, add almond milk (or other milk of choice), almond butter, maple syrup (or other
sweetener), chia seeds, and vanilla and stir with a spoon to combine and distribute the almond butter evenly.

### Step 2

Add oats, cocoa powder, and salt (optional) and mix well to incorporate the cocoa powder. Then press down with a spoon
to ensure all oats have been moistened and are immersed in almond milk.

### Step 3

Cover securely with a lid or seal and set in the refrigerator overnight (or for at least 6 hours) to set/soak.

### Step 4

The next day, open and enjoy as is or garnish with desired toppings (see suggestions above).

### Step 5

OPTIONAL: You can also heat your oats in the microwave for 45-60 seconds (just ensure there’s enough room at the top
of your jar to allow for expansion and prevent overflow and that you’ve used a microwave-safe jar or bowl), or
transfer oats to a saucepan and heat over medium heat until warmed through. Add more liquid as needed if oats get too
thick/dry.

### Step 6

Overnight oats will keep in the refrigerator for 2-3 days, though best within the first 12-24 hours in our experience.
Not freezer friendly.
