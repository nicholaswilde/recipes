## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Mix TJ’s Gluten Free Organic Rolled Oats with Ancient Grains & Seeds, applesauce, honey, salt, baking powder,
cinnamon, egg, and berries in a coffee mug. Stir well until thoroughly combined.

### Step 2

In a microwave oven, heat on high for 4 minutes*, or until mixture is no longer wet on the surface. The muffin will
expand as it cooks and may partially rise out of the mug.

### Step 3

Carefully remove the mug from the microwave, as it will be very hot, and let cool for about 5 minutes. Top with some
fresh berries (optional), drizzle with more honey if desired, and serve.
