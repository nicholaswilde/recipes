- 1.5 Tbsp flaxseed meal
- :droplet: 4 Tbsp water
- :banana: 0.33 cup mashed banana
- 0.25 cup agave or maple syrup
- 0.25 cup olive oil
- 0.5 cup unsweetened applesauce
- 0.5 cup [brown sugar][1]
- 1.5 tsp baking soda
- 0.5 tsp salt
- 0.5 tsp cinnamon
- :glass_of_milk: 0.5 cup almond milk
- :carrot: 1 heaping cup grated carrot
- :ear_of_rice: 0.67 cup oats
- 0.5 cup almond meal
- 1 heaping cup gluten-free flour blend

- 1 muffin tin
- 1 liners
- 1 whisk
- 1 toothpick

## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Prepare flax eggs in a large mixing bowl by mixing flaxseed meal and water and let rest for a few minutes. Preheat oven
to 375°F (190 C).

### Step 2

Prepare muffin tin with liners or lightly grease them.

### Step 3

To the flax eggs, add mashed banana, agave or maple syrup, olive oil and whisk to combine.

### Step 4

Next add unsweetened applesauce, brown sugar, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and whisk to combine.

### Step 5

Add almond milk and stir.

### Step 6

Add grated carrot and stir.

### Step 7

Add oats, almond meal, and gluten-free flour blend and stir.

### Step 8

Divide evenly among 12 muffin tins, filling them all the way up to the top, and top with crushed walnuts (optional).

### Step 9

Bake for 32 to 36 minutes, or until deep golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. When
you press on the top it shouldn’t feel too spongy, so don’t be afraid of over baking! The gluten-free blend just
takes longer to bake.

### Step 10

Remove from oven and let set in the pan for 15 minutes. Then flip on their sides still in the pan to let cool
completely.

### Step 11

If you try to unwrap them too quickly, they have a tendency to stick to the wrappers.

### Step 12

Once cooled, store in a covered container or bag at room temp to keep fresh. Freeze after that to keep fresh.
