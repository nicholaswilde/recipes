## :salt: Ingredients

- 1 orange
- 1 cup rolled oats
- 0.25 cup walnuts
- 2 Tbsp flaxseed meal
- 0.25 tsp cinnamon
- 1 banana
- 0.5 cup milk
- 2 kiwi

## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat a waffle iron. Using a grater or vegetable peeler, zest the orange.

### Step 2

In a bowl, combine the rolled oats, walnuts, flaxseed meal, orange zest, and cinnamon. Place two-thirds of the mixture
into a food processor or high-speed blender.

### Step 3

Blend until the mixture has a flour-like texture. Return to the bowl with the remaining one-third of the dry
ingredients; this step ensures that the waffles have a chunky texture. If you prefer a smoother, uniform texture to your
waffles, blend all of the dry ingredients initially.

### Step 4

Add the smashed banana and milk to the dry ingredients in the bowl. Mix thoroughly with a fork; the batter will be
fairly thick. If you prefer a thinner batter, add more milk.

### Step 5

Portion the batter thickly onto a preheated waffle iron and spread it out to all corners. Close the lid and cook the
waffle according to the manufacturer’s directions for your waffle iron. When done, remove the waffle from the iron
(some waffles require the assistance of a chopstick to encourage release from the waffle iron). Top with sliced kiwi,
raspberries, and maple syrup.
