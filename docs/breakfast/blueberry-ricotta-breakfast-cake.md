## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Grease and flour a 9-inch round springform pan, shaking out any excess flour.

### Step 2

Place the unsalted butter and granulated sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and
beat on medium speed for 3 minutes, until light and fluffy, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. With the
mixer on low, add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Add the whole-milk ricotta, sour cream, pure
vanilla extract, and grated lemon zest and mix well. (The batter will look curdled.)

### Step 3

In a small bowl, stir together the all-purpose flour, baking powder, and Kosher salt. With the mixer on low, slowly add
the dry ingredients to the batter, mixing just until incorporated. With a rubber spatula, fold two thirds of the fresh
blueberries into the batter. Transfer the batter to the prepared springform pan and smooth the top. Scatter the
remaining blueberries on the cake, pressing them lightly into the surface.

### Step 4

Bake for 45 minutes to 55 minutes, until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Transfer to a wire rack and
allow to cool in the pan for 15 minutes. Remove the sides of the pan and lightly dust the top with the confectioners'
sugar. Serve warm or at room temperature.
