## :cooking: Cookware

- 1 mason jar

## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

To a mason jar or small bowl with a lid, add almond milk, chia seeds, peanut butter, vanilla, and maple syrup (or other
sweetener) and stir with a spoon to combine. The peanut butter doesn't need to be completely mixed with the almond milk
(doing so leaves swirls of peanut butter to enjoy the next day).

### Step 2

Add rolled oats and stir a few more times. Then press down with a spoon to ensure all oats have been moistened and are
immersed in almond milk.

### Step 3

Cover securely with a lid or seal and set in the refrigerator overnight (or for at least 6 hours) to set/soak.

### Step 4

The next day, open and enjoy as is or garnish with desired toppings (see options above). See more flavor/topping
suggestions in the blog post above!

### Step 5

OPTIONAL: You can also heat your oats in the microwave for 45-60 seconds (just ensure there's enough room at the top of
your jar to allow for expansion and prevent overflow), or transfer oats to a saucepan and heat over medium heat until
warmed through. Add more liquid as needed if oats get too thick/dry.

### Step 6

Overnight oats will keep in the refrigerator for 2-3 days, though best within the first 12-24 hours in our experience.
Not freezer friendly.
