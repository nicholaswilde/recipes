## :cooking: Cookware

- 1 small bowl
- 1 floss or a very sharp knife
- 1 9 x 13 inch pan
- 1 parchment paper
- 1 dish cloth

## :pencil: Instructions - Dough

### Step 1

In a large bowl combine 2 cups of the all-purpose flour, instant yeast, salt and sugar in a bowl. Mix to combine.

### Step 2

In a microwave safe bowl, microwave the milk and butter for 30 seconds until warm and the butter is mostly melted. The
mixture should be warm, but not hot. If it is too hot, make sure to let it cool before adding to the yeast to prevent
killing the yeast. Add the warm milk and butter to the flour mixture.

### Step 3

Add the egg.

### Step 4

Beat on low speed, gradually increasing to high until completely combined, about 2 minutes.

### Step 5

Scrape down the bowl and add 1 more cup of flour, beating until combined. Add the remaining cup of flour in a little at
a time until the dough starts to pull away from the sides of the bowl and form a ball.

### Step 6

Turn the dough out onto a well floured surface and knead for about 10 minutes until smooth and you can stretch a piece
of dough out between your fingers without it breaking. This means the gluten has developed and your dough will be
pillowy soft.

### Step 7

Transfer the dough to an oiled bowl and cover. Let rise in a warm place for 1 hour or until the dough has doubled in
size.

## :pencil: Instructions - Cinnamon Sugar Filling

### Step 8

While the dough rises, make the filling. Combine the light brown sugar, cinnamon, and salt together in a small bowl and
mix well. Set aside.

### Step 9

Once the dough has risen, roll it out into a long rectangle about 18 x 12 inches on a well floured surface.

### Step 10

Spread the butter for the filling all the way to the edge of the dough. Sprinkle the sugar mixture over the butter,
pressing it down to stick to the butter.

### Step 11

From the long end, roll the dough away from you into a tight roll, sealing the bottom edge down by pinching the dough
together.

### Step 12

Use floss or a very sharp knife to cut the dough into 12 even rolls. Place the rolls in a 9 x 13 inch pan lined with
parchment paper. Cover loosely with a dish cloth and allow to rise for another hour until doubled in size and puffed up.

### Step 13

Bake the cinnamon rolls at 350°F for 30 minutes or until they are golden brown and no longer doughy. Allow to cool.

## :Pencil: Instructions - Cream Cheese Frosting

### Step 14

While the rolls cool, make the cream cheese frosting. In a stand mixer fit with the whisk attachment combine the cream
cheese, butter, confectioners' sugar, milk, salt, and vanilla extract. Beat on low speed, gradually increasing to high
until light and fluffy. Spread the icing evenly over the 12 rolls. Enjoy warm!
