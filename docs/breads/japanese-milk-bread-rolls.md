## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Weigh your bread flour; or measure it by gently spooning it into a cup, then sweeping off any excess.

### Step 2

To make the tangzhong: Combine bread flour, water, and whole milk in a small saucepan, and whisk until no lumps remain.

### Step 3

Place the saucepan over low heat, and cook the mixture, whisking constantly, until thick and the whisk leaves lines on
the bottom of the pan, about 3 to 5 minutes.

### Step 4

Transfer the tangzhong to a small mixing bowl or measuring cup and let it cool to room temperature.

### Step 5

To make the dough: Combine the tangzhong with the bread flour, milk powder, granulated sugar, salt, instant yeast, whole
milk, egg, and melted unsalted butter, then mix and knead - by hand, mixer, or bread machine - until a smooth, elastic
dough forms.

### Step 6

Shape the dough into a ball, and let it rest in a lightly greased covered bowl for 60 to 90 minutes, until puffy but not
necessarily doubled in bulk.

### Step 7

Gently deflate the dough, divide it into 8 equal pieces (for large rolls) or 10 equal pieces (for medium-sized rolls),
and shape each piece into a ball.

### Step 8

Place the rolls into a lightly greased 8" or 9" round cake pan. Cover the pan, and let the rolls rest for 40 to 50
minutes, until puffy.

### Step 9

Preheat the oven to 350°F. Brush the rolls with milk or egg wash (1 large egg beaten with 1 tablespoon cold water), and
bake for 25 to 30 minutes, until golden brown on top; a digital thermometer inserted into the center of the middle roll
should read at least 190°F.

### Step 10

Remove the rolls from the oven. Allow them to cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then transfer them to a rack to cool
completely.
