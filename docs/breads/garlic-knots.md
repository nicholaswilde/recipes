## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat oven to 400°F (205°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

### Step 2

In a large bowl, combine 1 cup bread flour (125 g), instant yeast (2.25 tsp), sugar, salt, and garlic powder and stir
well.

### Step 3

Add olive oil and warm water (105-115°F) (180 ml) and stir until well-combined.

### Step 4

Gradually add another 1 cup bread flour (125 g), then additional bread flour as needed until the dough forms a cohesive,
elastic ball.

### Step 5

Drizzle a separate bowl with olive oil, coat the dough, cover with plastic wrap, and let rise for 30 minutes or until
doubled in size.

### Step 6

Gently deflate the dough, transfer to a floured surface, form into a 15” log, and cut into 9 pieces.

### Step 7

Roll each piece into an 8” rope, tie into a knot, and place on the baking sheet. Lightly brush with olive oil if
desired.

### Step 8

Let garlic knots rest/rise for 5 minutes before baking.

### Step 9

Bake at 400°F (205°C) for 13 minutes or until light golden brown.

### Step 10

Meanwhile, combine salted butter and minced garlic (1.5 Tbsp) in a small saucepan over medium/low heat until melted and
fragrant. Remove from heat and stir in minced fresh basil.

### Step 11

Once knots are baked, brush generously with garlic butter and sprinkle with grated Parmesan cheese (optional) if
desired.

### Step 12

Serve warm.
