## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Heat 1/2 cup whole milk until lukewarm. Dissolve active dry yeast in milk. Let stand for 10 minutes.

### Step 2

Scald remaining milk, pour over salt and butter in large mixing bowl. Cool to lukewarm, add honey, dissolved yeast, and
wheat germ. Add stone ground whole wheat flour beating vigorously with wooden spoon until dough forms a ball.

### Step 3

Turn out on a well-floured board. Knead vigorously until dough is elastic and bubbles form. Place dough in a lightly
greased bowl. Cover, set in a warm place until doubled in bulk.

### Step 4

Place dough on floured board. Divide in two parts shaping loaves to fit 5-inch by 9-1/2-inch loaf pans. Grease loaf pans
well with unsalted shortening. Cover, let loaves rise in pans until almost doubled in bulk (about 1 hour) in a warm
place.

### Step 5

Bake in preheated 400°F oven for 15 minutes or until loaves begin to brown. Reduce oven to 350°F and bake about 40
minutes to 45 minutes longer or until bread is done.
