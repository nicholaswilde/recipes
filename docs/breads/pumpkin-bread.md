## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Heat the oven to 350°F. Oil an 8.5 or 9 inch loaf pan; line with parchment, leaving a 2 inch overhang on two sides.

### Step 2

In a medium bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, baking powder, cinnamon, salt and baking soda. In a large bowl,
whisk together the vegetable oil, pumpkin purée, granulated sugar, brown sugar, eggs, sour cream and vanilla. Fold the
dry ingredients into the wet ingredients until fully combined. Transfer the batter to the prepared pan and smooth into
an even layer.

### Step 3

Bake until the loaf is puffed and set, and a skewer inserted into the center comes out with moist crumbs attached, 60 to
75 minutes. Transfer the bread, in the pan, to a cooling rack to cool for 20 minutes. Use a paring knife to cut the two
exposed sides of bread away from the pan, then use the parchment to transfer the cake to the rack. Let cool completely.
