## :pencil: Instructions

!!! note
    Ricotta without stabilizers such as locust bean, guar, and xanthan gums drains more readily. You can substitute
    part-skim ricotta for the whole-milk ricotta. Frozen whole-leaf spinach is easiest to squeeze dry, but frozen chopped
    spinach will work. Squeezing the spinach should remove 1/2 to 2/3 cup of liquid; you should have 2/3 cup of finely
    chopped spinach. Our tomato-butter sauce isn't strictly canonical; if you'd prefer a more traditional accompaniment,
    substitute our Simple Tomato Sauce or browned butter and fresh sage. Serve with a simple salad.

### Step 1

FOR THE GNUDI: Line rimmed baking sheet with double layer of paper towels. Spread whole-milk ricotta in even layer over
towels; set aside and let sit for 10 minutes. Place all-purpose flour, Parmesan, panko, salt, pepper, and lemon zest in
large bowl and stir to combine. Process frozen whole-leaf spinach in food processor until finely chopped, about 30
seconds, scraping down sides of bowl as needed. Transfer spinach to bowl with flour mixture. Grasp paper towels and fold
ricotta in half; peel back towels. Rotate sheet 90 degrees and repeat folding and peeling 2 more times to consolidate
ricotta into smaller mass. Using paper towels as sling, transfer ricotta to bowl with spinach mixture. Discard paper
towels but do not wash sheet. Add egg whites to bowl and mix gently until well combined.

### Step 2

Transfer heaping teaspoons of dough to now-empty sheet (you should have 45 to 50 portions). Using your dry hands, gently
roll each portion into 1-inch ball.

### Step 3

FOR THE SAUCE: Melt unsalted butter in small saucepan over medium heat. Add thinly sliced garlic and cook, swirling
saucepan occasionally, until butter is very foamy and garlic is pale golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Off heat, add cherry
or grape tomatoes and cider vinegar; cover and set aside.

### Step 4

Bring 1 quart water to boil in Dutch oven. Add 1.5 teaspoons salt. Using spider skimmer or slotted spoon, transfer all
gnudi to water. Return water to gentle simmer. Cook, adjusting heat to maintain gentle simmer, for 5 minutes, starting
timer once water has returned to simmer (to confirm doneness, cut 1 dumpling in half; center should be firm).

### Step 5

While gnudi simmer, add salt and pepper to sauce and cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes
are warmed through and slightly softened, about 2 minutes. Divide sauce evenly among 4 bowls. Using spider skimmer or
slotted spoon, remove gnudi from pot, drain well, and transfer to bowls with sauce. Garnish with basil and extra
Parmesan. Serve immediately.
