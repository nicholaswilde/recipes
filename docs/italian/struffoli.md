## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

In a bowl, mix together eggs, granulated sugar, extra virgin olive oil and salt. Grate the orange (for zest) directly
into the bowl.

### Step 2

Slowly mix in the all purpose flour until a firm dough has formed. Turn out onto a floured surface and knead for 10
minutes or so.

### Step 3

Wrap in plastic and allow it to rest at room temperature for about 1 hour.

### Step 4

Cut the dough into 8 pieces and keep covered. Take one piece of dough and roll into a rope about 18 inches long. Cut
into small pieces about 0.5 inch lengths or slightly smaller than a marble. Repeat with all the dough.

### Step 5

Heat light olive oil in a deep frying pan filled with about 1 inch of oil to 375°F. Prepare a baking sheet lined with
paper towels.

### Step 6

When the oil is ready, fry handfuls of the struffoli, stirring to separate the pieces and allowing them to brown and
puff up. Remove from the oil with a slotted spoon and drain on the paper towel to remove excess oil. Repeat with all the
dough.

### Step 7

To make the honey sauce and coat the dough balls: Place the honey and granulated sugar in a wide frying pan or skillet.
Heat to dissolve the sugar then bring to a gentle boil. Simmer for 3 minutes to 5 minutes until the sauce is glossy and
thickens a little. Don't let it brown or overcook.

### Step 8

Add the fried dough balls, stir and cook over low-medium heat for 5 minutes until all the honey balls are coated.

### Step 9

Remove from the heat and allow to stand for a few minutes to cool and thicken. Stir well.

### Step 10

Pile on a serving plate and decorate with colored sprinkles.
