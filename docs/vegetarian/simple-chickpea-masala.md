## :cooking: Cookware

- 1 medium skillet
- 1 potato masher
- 1 spatula

## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Heat neutral cooking oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add cumin seeds and brown mustard seeds and cook for 1
minute, or until the mustard seeds either begin to pop or turn a grayish color. Stir constantly.

### Step 2

Add yellow onion (finely diced) and cook for 5 minutes, until softened. Add ground coriander, ground cumin, ground
turmeric, cayenne pepper, and finely ground black pepper and cook for 30 seconds more, or until fragrant, stirring
constantly. Add diced tomatoes and cook for 1 minute.

### Step 3

Stir in cooked chickpeas and water. Cover and simmer for 10 minutes. Use a potato masher or the side of a spatula to
partially mash about a third of the chickpeas to add some texture to the sauce. Add unsweetened coconut cream (if
using), 2 tablespoons at a time, until the desired texture. Mix well to combine.

### Step 4

Stir in salt, freshly squeezed lemon juice, and fresh cilantro (chopped). If desired, serve with cashew yogurt or Yogurt
Drizzle Sauce (optional).
