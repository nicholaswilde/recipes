## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat your oven to 425°F.

### Step 2

Place a paper towel on a sheet pan, put the chickpeas (drained and rinsed) on top of it, and roll them around a bit to
dry them off. Remove the paper towel and drizzle the chickpeas with the extra-virgin olive oil. Sprinkle with the kosher
salt, garlic powder, and sweet paprika and use your hands to mix everything well. Roast, shaking the pan once or twice
during cooking, until the chickpeas are browned and crispy, about 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool
before using (they will crisp as they cool).

### Step 3

Place all the dressing ingredients: garlic, capers (including the brine!), red wine vinegar, fresh lemon juice, vegan
mayonnaise, extra-virgin olive oil, kosher salt, freshly ground black pepper, and nutritional yeast in the pitcher of a
blender and puree until smooth. Season the dressing to taste with more salt and/or pepper if needed.

### Step 4

Place the kale (tough stems removed, roughly chopped) in a large bowl and squeeze the juice from the lemon half over it.
Add a large pinch of kosher salt and use your hands to scrunch it all together. Really get in there—don't be shy! This
will help make the kale easier to eat. Drizzle with 1/2 cup of the dressing and use your hands or tongs to mix the salad
well. Transfer to a serving platter (or just serve from the bowl).

### Step 5

Top the salad with the chickpeas and drizzle with another 1/4 cup or so of the dressing. Serve immediately.
