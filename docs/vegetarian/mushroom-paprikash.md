## :salt: Ingredients

- 3 tbsp olive oil
- 1 medium yellow onion
- 2 tbsp sweet paprika
- some water
- 16 oz mushrooms
- some salt
- 1 cup sour cream
- some egg noodles or spaetzle

## :cooking: Cookware

- 1 large pan or Dutch oven

## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Add olive oil to a large pan or Dutch oven (enough to coat the bottom well), and turn the heat on medium-low. Add the
yellow onion (finely diced or grated), and sauté just until it begins to turn translucent and golden.

### Step 2

Next, add the sweet paprika and turn the heat low. (You can add a tiny splash of water here, to ensure the paprika
doesn't burn.) Keep the heat low from here on out, and keep an eye on the pan to make sure the paprika doesn't start to
darken.

### Step 3

Add the mushrooms (sliced thin) and quickly stir them into the onion mixture so they're well coated, and sauté,
stirring frequently. You can inch the heat up a little once the mushrooms have released their liquid, but be careful not
to let it boil off entirely.

### Step 4

Once the mushrooms are nice and soft, take the pan off the heat and give it a quick taste. Add a little salt here, if it
needs it.

### Step 5

Stir in the sour cream, adding more as needed. You want it a bit thicker than a sauce — more like the consistency of
whole-milk yogurt.

### Step 6

Boil up your egg noodles or spaetzle, and serve beneath a good scoop of paprikash.
