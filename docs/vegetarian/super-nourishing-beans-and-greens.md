## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

In a Dutch oven or a large rimmed skillet with a lid, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Once hot, add the shallot and
sauté for 1 to 2 minutes, until fragrant and translucent. Turn the heat down to medium low and add the garlic and red
pepper flakes. Sauté for 1 minute more.

### Step 2

Return the heat to medium and add the chopped Swiss chard (or greens of choice). Toss to coat the greens in the oil and
distribute the shallot and garlic. Once the greens are just beginning to wilt, add the white beans and salt and stir to
combine.

### Step 3

Add the 1.5-2 cups water or vegetable stock and lemon juice then cover and simmer for 15 to 25 minutes, until the greens
are tender, the beans have softened, and the mixture is a bit saucy but most of the water has evaporated. Add more water
or vegetable stock and cover as needed to achieve the desired consistency of your greens and beans.

### Step 4

Serve immediately! Delicious on its own as a quick meal, or served with toast, grains, sriracha tofu (optional), salmon,
or eggs. Keeps for 3-4 days in the refrigerator or up to 1 month in the freezer.
