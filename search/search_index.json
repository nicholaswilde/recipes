If there isn't, don't use the broiler. Your pizza will still be great without being broiled, though it may take a few more minutes to bake., Gently slide the pizza (or pizza and parchment) onto the steel or stone. Bake the pizza for approximately 6 minutes on the steel (or 7 minutes on the stone), until bubbly and charred on the edges. Remove the pizza from the oven and top it with freshly grated Parmesan, if desired., Repeat with the remaining dough and toppings.</p> <p>Tip</p> <p>Substitute an equal amount of all-purpose flour for a slightly less chewy crust. No other changes are necessary.</p> <p>Tip</p> <p>To make the \"Veg Vinaigrette Pizza\": Top your pie with red sauce and add a sprinkle of grated mozzarella followed by roasted butternut squash or roasted sweet potato. Bake as directed. Remove the pizza from the oven and drizzle with your favorite vinaigrette. When the vinaigrette hits the hot surface it blooms \u2014 i.e., becomes super aromatic. Top with quick-pickled red onions (or other pickled items in your fridge, like capers) or radishes for color, and finish with a sprinkle of feta or crumbled blue cheese.</p> <p>Tip</p> <p>To make the \"Smoky-Sweet Pizza\": Top your pie with a thin layer of BBQ sauce and sprinkle with grated mozzarella. Add sliced pears, bacon that\u2019s been cooked about halfway (pliable, not crispy), and thinly sliced scallions that have been flash-fried in oil. Bake the pizza as directed. To finish, drizzle with BBQ sauce from a squirt bottle, or BBQ sauce mixed with tomato sauce (roughly equal measures of each).</p> <p>Tip</p> <p>The maximum temperature rating for most parchment paper is below 500\u00b0F, and at temperatures between 450\u00b0F and 500\u00b0F parchment\u2019s exposed edges begin to char. To be safe, keep a close eye on anything being cooked at temperatures above 450\u00b0F (especially anything on an upper rack).

Place the dough ingredients into your machine in the order listed and choose the dough or manual cycle. When the cycle is done, remove the risen dough and shape and bake as directed in the recipe above. Note: Due to the many brands of bread machine on the market and their different features, we can\u2019t guarantee you can bake this bread start to finish in your own machine; please use the dough or manual cycle instead.</p> <p>Tip</p> <p>The liquid sweetener you choose makes a difference. Molasses produces the darkest loaf, one with old-fashioned flavor. Honey yields a lighter, milder loaf. Maple syrup makes a less-sweet loaf \u2014 unless you use real maple syrup, in which case it'll be similar to a loaf made with honey, albeit with a faint hint of maple.</p> <p>Tip</p> <p>If you're someone who tends to taste whole wheat as somewhat bitter, try substituting 1/4 cup of orange juice for 1/4 cup of the water in this recipe. A bit of orange juice tones down whole wheat's somewhat tannic taste.</p> <p>Tip</p> <p>Want to prolong the shelf life of this bread? Try the tangzhong technique, an Asian method for increasing the softness and shelf life of yeast bread. Begin by measuring out the flour and water you\u2019ll be using in the recipe. Now take 3 tablespoons of the measured flour and 1/2 cup of the water; put them in a saucepan set over medium-high heat. Cook the mixture, whisking constantly, until it forms a thick slurry; this will take about 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 minutes. Transfer the cooked mixture to a bowl, let it cool to lukewarm, then combine it with the remaining flour, the remaining water (+ 2 additional tablespoons), and the other dough ingredients. Proceed with the recipe as directed. Well-wrapped and stored at room temperature, your finished loaf should stay soft and fresh at room temperature for at least several days.</p>","tags":["bread","king-arthur"]},{"location":"breads/whole-wheat-bread/#source","title":"Source","text":"<ul> <li>https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/classic-100-whole-wheat-bread-recipe</li> </ul>","tags":["bread","king-arthur"]},{"location":"breakfast/1-bowl-carrot-apple-muffins/","title":"1-Bowl Carrot Apple Muffins","text":"Total Time 51 minutes","tags":["breakfast","muffins"]},{"location":"breakfast/1-bowl-carrot-apple-muffins/#ingredients","title":"Ingredients","text":"<ul> <li>1.5 Tbsp flaxseed meal</li> <li> 4 Tbsp water</li> <li> 0.33 cup mashed banana</li> <li> 0.25 cup agave or maple syrup</li> <li> 0.25 cup olive oil</li> <li> 0.5 cup unsweetened applesauce</li> <li> 0.5 cup brown sugar</li> <li> 1.5 tsp baking soda</li> <li> 0.5 tsp salt</li> <li> 0.5 tsp cinnamon</li> <li> 0.5 cup almond milk</li> <li> 1 heaping cup grated carrot</li> <li> 0.67 cup oats</li> <li> 0.5 cup almond meal</li> <li> 1 heaping cup gluten-free flour blend</li> <li> 0.25 cup walnuts (optional)</li> </ul>","tags":["breakfast","muffins"]},{"location":"breakfast/1-bowl-carrot-apple-muffins/#cookware","title":"Cookware","text":"<ul> <li>1 large mixing bowl</li> <li>1 muffin tin</li> <li>1 liners</li> <li>1 whisk</li> <li>1 toothpick</li> </ul>","tags":["breakfast","muffins"]},{"location":"breakfast/1-bowl-carrot-apple-muffins/#instructions","title":"Instructions","text":"","tags":["breakfast","muffins"]},{"location":"breakfast/1-bowl-carrot-apple-muffins/#step-1","title":"Step 1","text":"<p>Prepare flax eggs in a large mixing bowl by mixing flaxseed meal and water and let rest for a few minutes.

Aquafaba is almost essential for everyday baking\u2014especially for vegans\u2014because it\u2019s a great binder and can fluff up and trap air and serve as an excellent alternative to eggs. Here are the most common uses:</p> <ul> <li>Egg Replacement \u2013 Use 3 tablespoons of liquid per egg in any recipe.</li> <li>Meringues and Macarons \u2013 Yay! These fancy little desserts are accessible to vegans again. Whip your aquafaba into   impossibly stiff peaks with a hand mixer or standing mixer and a pinch of cream of tartar. This might take 10 minutes   or more, but it\u2019s totally worth it.</li> <li>Aquafaba Whipped Cream \u2013 Light fluffy vegan whipped cream made from chickpea water? Sounds preposterous, but it\u2019s   perfection!</li> <li>Crusty Layer \u2013 Brush onto potatoes or the tops of pies before baking for a little added crispiness.</li> <li>Egg White Substitute \u2013 Beaten into semi-stiff peaks (for about 5 minutes), this mixture is wonderful for adding   into waffles or other baked items.</li> <li>Chocolate Mousse \u2013 A marvelous mousse can be made with only whipped aquafaba, sugar and dark chocolate. So creamy   and thick, you won\u2019t believe your eyes. This recipe from Lazy Cat Kitchen is really dreamy.</li> <li>Buttercream Frosting \u2013 Aquafaba makes a great base for buttercream that forms the most terrific texture. I like   this recipe by Geeky Cakes. A bit more involved, but it produces a truly professional frosting.</li> <li>Vegan Marshmallows or \u2018Marshmallow\u2019 Fluff \u2013 You can make your own vegetarian marshmallows from scratch using   aquafaba!</li> <li>Vegan Cheese \u2013 This recipe from Avocados and Ales is pretty popular and provides the most mouthwatering and   meltable results for a plant-based mozzarella cheese.</li> </ul>","tags":["ingredient"]},{"location":"ingredients/aquafaba/#instructions-stove-top-method","title":"Instructions - Stove Top Method","text":"","tags":["ingredient"]},{"location":"ingredients/aquafaba/#step-1","title":"Step 1","text":"<p>Soak 1 cup of dry chickpeas overnight in filtered water.</p>","tags":["ingredient"]},{"location":"ingredients/aquafaba/#step-2","title":"Step 2","text":"<p>The next day, drain and rinse the beans thoroughly.</p>","tags":["ingredient"]},{"location":"ingredients/aquafaba/#step-3","title":"Step 3","text":"<p>Add beans to a pot and cover with several inches of water.</p>","tags":["ingredient"]},{"location":"ingredients/aquafaba/#step-4","title":"Step 4","text":"<p>Bring to a boil on high heat, lower heat, and simmer for 1.5 \u2013 2 hours.</p>","tags":["ingredient"]},{"location":"ingredients/aquafaba/#step-5","title":"Step 5","text":"<p>Drain bean water into another pot or large mason jar to cool.</p>","tags":["ingredient"]},{"location":"ingredients/aquafaba/#step-6","title":"Step 6","text":"<p>Save the cooked beans to use later.</p>","tags":["ingredient"]},{"location":"ingredients/aquafaba/#instructions-pressure-cooker-method","title":"Instructions - Pressure Cooker Method","text":"","tags":["ingredient"]},{"location":"ingredients/aquafaba/#step-7","title":"Step 7","text":"<p>Pressure Cooker Method: Soak 1 cup of dry chickpeas overnight in filtered water.</p>","tags":["ingredient"]},{"location":"ingredients/aquafaba/#step-8","title":"Step 8","text":"<p>The next day, drain and rinse the beans thoroughly.</p>","tags":["ingredient"]},{"location":"ingredients/aquafaba/#step-9","title":"Step 9","text":"<p>Place beans into the Instant Pot (or your favorite pressure cooker) and add just enough liquid to cover the beans completely.</p>","tags":["ingredient"]},{"location":"ingredients/aquafaba/#step-10","title":"Step 10","text":"<p>Pressure cook on HIGH for 15 to 18 minutes.

We also give a variation made with powdered egg whites that does not require heat. Avoid making Royal icing on humid days. Be sure that any container or utensils that comes in contact with the icing is grease-free, and do not store the icing in a plastic container.

If submerging, it will take an hour or so and will require changing the water a couple of times to make sure it stays very warm. Once defrosted, open the container and drain out excess water.

For baking purposes, a gram is the same as a milliliter.</p> Imperial Metric 1 tsp 5 ml/g 1 Tbsp 15 ml/g 1 ounce 28.35 (or 30) ml/g 1 cup 227 (or 230) ml/g 1 lb 450 ml/g 2.2 lbs 1 kilogram <p>And should you be faced with an overseas oven, here are some temperature conversions from Fahrenheit to centigrade, with the gas marks, used in some countries, as well.</p> Fahrenheit Celsius or Gas Mark 225\u00b0F 100\u00b0C or Gas Mark 1/4 250\u00b0F 130\u00b0C or Gas Mark 1/2 275\u00b0F 140\u00b0C or Gas Mark 1 300\u00b0F 150\u00b0C or Gas Mark 2 325\u00b0F 170\u00b0C or Gas Mark 3 350\u00b0F 180\u00b0C or Gas Mark 4 375\u00b0F 190\u00b0C or Gas Mark 5 400\u00b0F 200\u00b0C or Gas Mark 6 425\u00b0F 220\u00b0C or Gas Mark 7 450\u00b0F 230\u00b0C or Gas Mark 8 475\u00b0F 240\u00b0C or Gas Mark 9 <ol> <li> <p>The scoop# may be found by measuring the scoop bowl diameter if the scoop# is not printed on the scoop.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>The King Arthur Baking Company All-Purpose Baker's Companion\u00a0\u21a9\u21a9</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"reference/pressure-cooker/","title":"Pressure Cooker","text":"<p>Times used to cook certain foods in a Instant Pot pressure cooker.</p> Name Cook Time Natural Pressure Release Time Total Time  Raw to Cooked Ratio by Volume  Water to Food Ratio by Volume Brown rice 15 min 5 min 20 min 1:3 1.25-1.5:1 Pinto beans 45 min 15 min 60 min 1:3 2.5-3:1 Garbanzo beans 60 min 20 min 1 hr 20 min 1:2.5 4:1 Black beans 50 min 20 min 1 hr 10 min 1:2.5 3:1 Black eyed peas 8-10 min 15 min 22-25 min 1:3 2:1"},{"location":"reference/seasons/","title":"Seasons","text":"<p>A table of fruits and vegetables and when they are in season.</p> Food Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Apples X X X X X X X X X X X Asparagus X X Beet Greens X X X X X Beets X X X X X X X X X Blackberries X X Blueberries X X X Broccoli X X X X X X Brussels Sprouts X X X Cabbage X X X X X X X X X X Cantaloupe X X Carrots X X X X X X X X X Cauliflower X X X X Celery X X X X Cherries X Collard Greens X X X X X X Corn X X X X Cucumbers X X X X Currants X Dried Beans X X X X X X X X X X X X Eggplant X X X X Garlic X X X X X X Grapes X X X Herbs X X X X X X X X X X X X Kale X X X Leeks X X X X X Lettuce X X X X X X Lima Beans X X Mustard greens X X X X X X Onions X X X X X X X X X X X X Parsnips X X X X X X X X Peaches X X Pears X X X X X X X Peas X X X X Peppers X X X X Plums X X X Potatoes X X X X X X X X X X X X Prunes X X Pumpkins X X X Radishes X X X X X Raspberries X X X Rhubarb X X X Snap Beans X X X X Spinach X X X X X X Strawberries X X Summer Squash X X X X X Swiss Chard X X X X X Tomatoes X X X X Turnip Greens X X X X Turnips X X X X X X X X Watermelon X X Winter Squash X X X X X X X Zucchini X X X X"},{"location":"reference/spirits/","title":"Spirits","text":"Spirit Description Abricot du Roussillon Add some to Champagne, Chantilly and, of course, apricots. Amaretto This will augment the flavor of almonds in a cake and is delicious in ganache and Chantilly. Armagnac A classic with prunes and chestnuts, Armagnac is found in many a winter cake. Calvados An essential in apple cakes. Clear Creek Distillery makes an apple brandy that has been aged eight years and is the closest American option. Chambord The black raspberry liqueur. It is delicious in a soaking syrup for a genoise topped with fresh berries and Chantilly. Added to buttercream, it complements a lemon cake beautifully. Cognac Offers a rounded, enveloping elegance that gives a complex dimension to even a simple Chantilly cream. Cointreau &amp; Grand Marnier Both are made with oranges, but Grand Marnier, made with bitter oranges, has a brandy base and is aged in oak. Cointreau is sweeter, transparent and livelier, but less complex. If I want the citrusy brightness, I turn to Cointreau. If I want a sophisticated undercurrent of orange, I reach for Grand Marnier. Creme de Casis The ruby of Kir, it is what elevates a simple coulis of raspberries as easily as it turns a genoise syrup or buttercream into something French. Creme de Framboise Use this as you would creme de cassis whenever the taste of raspberries is desired. Clearly a great match for a bowl of summer berries, in a coulis or added to a chocolate ganache. A tablespoon will lightly scent a batch of madeleines or financiers. Creme de Peche Add to a glass of Champagne or anything with peaches. Frangelico A wonderful alternative to hazelnut extract, Frangelico has notes of vanilla in it as well as a touch of coffee. Limoncello Use on a bowl of berries, in Chantilly, as a soaking syrup, in a glaze, brushed on a genoise or brightening up a buttercream. Limonsardo is a Sardinian version that is a little less sweet. Poire Williams This pear liqueur amplifies the pear notes in a pear cake, but it is also lovely in chocolate mousse. Pear and almond are the closest of friends and show up together in everything from simple yogurt pear cakes to frangipane pear tarts. Rum Substitute with vanilla extract. Add three to four times the amount of rum as you would vanilla, if substituting. Or add both, as familiar vanilla dances with the more spirited rum. St. Germain or Fleur de Sureau Sauvage Elderflower likes lemons, limes, and roses.","tags":["reference"]},{"location":"reference/temperatures/","title":"Temperatures","text":""},{"location":"reference/temperatures/#miscellaneous","title":"Miscellaneous","text":"Temperature \u00b0F Description Notes 145-155 Reheat temperature Set oven temperature to 275 350 Butter burns - 365 Oil saut\u00e9 Mushrooms, onion, etc. 365 Oil fry Onion rings 450 Clarified butter burns -"},{"location":"reference/temperatures/#sugar-stages","title":"Sugar Stages","text":"Temperature \u00b0F Description Notes 235-240 Soft-Ball Stage Fudge, pralines, fondant 245-250 Firm-Ball Stage Caramels 250-265 Hard-Ball Stage Nougat, marshmallows, gummies, divinity, and rock candy 270-290 Soft-Crack Stage Saltwater taffy, butterscotch 300-310 Hard-Crack Stage Toffee, nut brittles, lollipops"},{"location":"reference/temperatures/#tempering-chocolate","title":"Tempering Chocolate","text":"Temperature Dark Milk While &amp; Dulcey Temp #1 122\u00b0F (50\u00b0C)-131\u00b0F (55\u00b0C) 113\u00b0F (45\u00b0C)-122\u00b0F (50\u00b0C) 113\u00b0F (45\u00b0C)-122\u00b0F (50\u00b0C) Temp #2 82\u00b0F (28\u00b0C)-84\u00b0F (29\u00b0C) 81\u00b0F (27\u00b0C)-82\u00b0F (28\u00b0C) 79\u00b0F (26\u00b0C)-81\u00b0F (27\u00b0C) Temp #3 88\u00b0F (31\u00b0C)-90\u00b0F (32\u00b0C) 84\u00b0F (29\u00b0C)-86\u00b0F (30\u00b0C) 82\u00b0F (28\u00b0C)-84\u00b0F (29\u00b0C)"},{"location":"reference/tips/","title":"Tips","text":"<p>Tips acquired throughout my cooking journey.

But the base agent's impact on the dough is actually terrific: It boosts flavorful browning by accelerating Maillardization and caramelizing sugars in the dough. It imparts that unique pretzel smell and taste by inhibiting the creation of typical baked-good aroma compounds while spurring the formation of others and also adds unmistakable mineral flavor. And it gels surface starch, so the pretzels bake up smooth and shiny.</p> <p>The stronger the alkali, the more intense and impressive the results, which is why German bakers use lye; it features a chart-topping pH of 14 and produces the ultimate pretzel experience. (Rest assured, you're not ingesting a dangerous chemical: The oven's heat completely neutralizes lye and makes it safe to consume.) That said, if sourcing and handling lye isn't for you, you can use a simmering baking soda solution instead. With a pH of roughly 8.3, it reacts less than lye and yields pretzels that are lighter in color and flavor, but the results are still impressive.</p>"},{"location":"sides/laugenbrezeln-%28german-lye-pretzels%29/#how-to-work-with-lye-safely","title":"How to Work with Lye Safely","text":"<p>Dipping the dough in a lye solution gives traditional German pretzels their characteristic salinity; chew; and smooth mahogany exterior, but the strong alkali (sodium hydroxide) is corrosive and can burn your skin, so it must be handled with caution.
